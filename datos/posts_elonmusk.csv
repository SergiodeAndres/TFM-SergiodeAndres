"120","2016-11-28","Did some further digging into the organisation behind the Elon Musk smear website","The website in question: https://stopelonfromfailingagain.com/about/

The website is funded by **The Citizens for the Republic** (http://www.cftr.org/about/; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_the_Republic), originally a Reagan-era “grass roots” political organisation which has recently been re-established. Unsurprisingly the members named on their website have many links to Reagan and his administration, but a quick bit of googling revealed numerous links to climate change denial and the incoming Trump administration.

The main players:

•	**Craig Shirley** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Shirley). Has given contributions to many Republican candidates over the years (http://individual-contributors.insidegov.com/d/c/Craigan-Shirley) including:
o	*Deborah Pryce* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Pryce#Environmental_record)
o	*Kyle McSlarrow* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_E._McSlarrow#US_Department_of_Energy)
o	*Richard Burr* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burr#Environmental_issues)
o	*Peter Rusthoven*, who is now working for Mike Pence (http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202772885344/In-Trying-to-Shield-Disclosure-of-His-Emails-Pence-Wants-It-Both-Ways?slreturn=20161028143817)
o	*Michael Steele* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Steele#Environment_and_energy) 
o	*Donald Devin*e (see below)
o	*George Allen* (see below)

•	**Diana Banister**
o	Runs *Shirley & Banister* with the above, and provide legal support to many nefarious right wing causes (http://www.sbpublicaffairs.com/work/)

•	**Laura Ingraham** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham) 
o	In line for next White House Press Secretary (http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/14/media/laura-ingraham-press-secretary/)
o	Has contributed to *Texas Patriots Tea Party* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Patriots_PAC)

More interestingly, **The Citizens for the Republic** is registered to *919 Prince St, Alexandria*, which turns out to be a hub of Republican lawyers and professional Climate Change denial (https://homemetry.com/Alexandria+VA/PRINCE+ST/919)

•	**John Mclaughlin & Associates**
o	Current advisor and pollster for *Donald Trump* amongst others (http://mclaughlinonline.com/client-list/political-clients/)
o	Prolific political contributor, including to *George Allen* (see below); *Fred Thomson* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Fred_Thompson#Global_warming); and *Rudy Giuliani*...
o	I also found an ad agency represented by Mclaughlin **“Florida Enterprise Four”** is also registered at 919 Prince St, which spent $10s of thousands in ads on Orlando’s Local 6 WKNG station in 2012 (https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/518204/fl-enterprise-four-13530012131040-_-pdf.pdf) – would be interesting to know what these ads were for…

•	**The Original Talk Radio Network**
o	A controversial right wing radio station (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/23/the-godfather-of-right-wing-radio.html)

•	**Christopher B. Ashby**’s Law firm (http://foiacouncil.dls.virginia.gov/members.htm), a member of the *Republican National Lawyers Association* and former speechwriter for *George Allen*, who started the climate change denying *Energy Freedom Center* (http://www.energyfreedomcenter.org/index.php/studies/global-warming/)

•	**Coalition to Reduce Spending** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_to_Reduce_Spending)

•	**Phoenix Limited Company** – couldn’t find much info but it’s a “religious” organisation founded by *“Craigan Shirley”* (see above)

•	**Donald Devine Company**, a Republican polling company, is also registered at 919 Prince St (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KJkdY2Oj_RQC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=919+Prince+St.Alexandria,+VA+22314&source=bl&ots=FRc_fVynOJ&sig=Hzv1KdtIhxPEeZxLo7nH43gJ00A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw5Z6X9cvQAhUmJJoKHb2wB5kQ6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&q=919%20Prince%20St.Alexandria%2C%20VA%2022314&f=false)
o	*Donald J. Devine* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Devine) 
o	Served under *Reagan* (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=43413)
o	An academic with links to *The Fund for American Studies* (http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=1912); The *Heritage Foundation* (http://www.heritage.org/); *The Philadephia Society* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Society); *The Heartland Institute* (https://www.heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/dr-donald-j-devine; http://blog.heartland.org/2015/10/heartland-daily-podcast-an-afternoon-with-angelo-codevilla-donald-j-devine-pt-1/; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heartland_Institute); *Cato Institute* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute)
o	Has made political contributions (http://individual-contributors.insidegov.com/l/12357411/Donald-Devine) to *Steve Forbes* (a Giuliani supporter - http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/17/steve-forbes-rudy-giuliani-deserves-better-from-anti-trump-activists.html) and *Michael Steele* (see above)

^Edit: Here are the relevant passages:  
> We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, **and tunnels**, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

> We stand at the birth of a new millennium, **ready to unlock the mysteries of space**, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, **and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow**.

And it's no secret that rail is the best method of moving freight. Countries with excellent rails systems also tend to do well economically.

Solar City: Power generation on Mars.

Tesla: No/Little Oxygen, therefore no internal combustion engines on Mars. Internal combustion engines in an enclosed environment such as a domed or subterranean city is a bad idea, especially when Oxygen is a critical resource and the combustion products would be concentrated. Calling it now, Tesla will collaborate  with  SpaceX and announce a Rover or some sort of Mars Land vehicle in the next few years.

Boring Company: The surface of Mars is fairly radioactive and has a High UV content because of the weak magnetic field and thin atmosphere. Having the technology to bore large tunnels makes it easy to have subterranean settlements, mine resources, and have safe hyperloop passages.

OpenAI: Manage settlements. Ai will be able to optimize crop growth, manage citizen health and spot issues with communities in several months that aren't obvious now.

SpaceX: I don't really have to elaborate here do I?

1st=Print, coal, steam engine

2nd=Telephone, fossil fuels, cars

Future revolution=Internet, cheap renewables, and self-driving vehicles

The future supply chain will be powered cheaply by advanced solar and wind energy, run by AI machines all connected and controlled through the internet. This will make almost all business more efficient thus allowing an economic boom.

Elon will be involved in all these areas with Starlink, solar city, Tesla, and SpaceX.

In addition to supply chain improvement there will also be big improvements for consumers:

Housing bills- (Solar City) install a solar roof to supply your energy or buy energy from your neighbor with excess energy from his solar roof. Blockchain technology (power ledger) allows the peer to peer sale of solar energy thus eliminating the middleman, saving the consumer money and reducing effects on the environment. All house appliances and heating could be run on this energy. In addition to power and heat, your internet/phone/TV may also be supplied by Starlink depending on its success/cost. (optimistic)

Transportation- (Tesla)You could either own an electric car and charge it via the energy mentioned above or use driverless taxi service. For long distance use BFR earth to earth to fly across the globe in less than an hour. Or to Mars!!

All of these systems can be implemented anywhere in the world. In this future, a portion of the global spending on bills and travel could be paid indirectly to one company/ companies owned by Elon. Why not make your own global currency to allow ease of entry to all citizens of the world and reduce fees? Enter cryptocurrency. This crypto coin could allow you to pay for energy, internet, driverless taxis or BFR flights. With the cryptocurrency, many other blockchain applications can be applied such as supply chain tracking, vehicle records, p2p energy trading and others yet to be discovered. 

In addition, having an ICO would be a great way to raise funds for projects such a Starlink or BFR development, which will both be incredibly costly. This provides a way to raise money while also still retaining all the autonomy of being a private company. In crypto, you don’t have to listen to your shareholders.

Edit: A Mars coin was mentioned in the comments as another potential use case for a cryptocurrency. Physical currency will not be brought to Mars nor will it be tied to a specific country. "

"190","2018-05-10","Introducing Grimes for Elon fans","Because some people are asking about Elon's new partner, here's a little introduction. **Grimes** is the alias of [Claire Elise Boucher](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=claire+boucher), an amazing Canadian singer, songwriter, producer, model, visual artist and director. Basically she makes all her music, she draws her own artwork, directs and edits her music videos. She was born in Vancouver on 17 March 1988 \(so, she's 30 now\). You may ask: why this alias? Over a decade ago when she created [her Myspace account](https://myspace.com/grimesgrime) she picked her name based on [the music genre named Grime](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/grimes-admits-moniker-grime-genre-option-myspace).

She released 4 studio albums and many various songs. She is very acclaimed and for a good reason, because her work is ***really great***. Picture Kraftwerk, Mariah Carey, Cocteau Twins, Aphex Twin, Bjork, Kylie Minogue, Enya, Skinny Puppy, all collaborating and you're pretty close to her style. 2 of her major inspirations are Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and Kate Bush, 2 artists known for being completely in charge of their artistic vision. Grimes is known for working hard, sometimes spending entire nights tinkering with her music in her own private home studio.

Other things? Grimes studied neuroscience, philosophy and Russian literature at the best Canadian university \(McGill\) but she didn't finish her studies because she started focusing on her music and drawings. Also she was a ballerina for 11 years. She's a sci\-fi / fantasy nerd \(she loves Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Solaris, The 5th Element and others, her album Geidi Primes references Dune  and she's interested in AI\), gamer, philanthropist, businesswoman. She has a lisp and she was bullied as a kid because she was goth weirdo. Overall she's a very interesting artist.

Claire has many famous fans such as Lorde, Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, Julian Casablancas, Elton John, Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches,  Janelle Monae, St. Vincent, Flying Lotus, Rihanna, M83, Lady Gaga, M.I.A., Joanna Newsom, Shirley Manson and many others. It's pretty weird how much Grimes acomplished in less than 10 years, [from a nobody playing ukulele in a cold warehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7rM67NPhZ8) in front of maybe 10 people to one of the most respected popstars in the world. This is what I'm calling determination and talent.

I made a selection of some of her best songs \(the first 3 are Elon's favorites\):

I personified her as the target of my disdain with this so-called ""nano""-craze. And while this craze has certainly spread, Ms. Divisekera is certainly not an accomplice to it.)

Nanobiologist* here. 

Some of you might have seen /r/quityourbullshit latest [ post on Elon calling out ""nano"" not being a science.  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/8m1mfm/elon_thinks_nano_bs/) Actually, for more than a decade now the word ""nano"" has been used as a buzz-word for all sorts of scientific fields and research projects that actually have very little to do with nanotechnology.

Most fields that deal with nano-technology are kind of ground-breaking, and most of it is theoretical. Most recent advances have been in material science, although calling that nano-tech is an obscene compliment in itself, and most important of all biology. Bionanotechnology is a field that shows real promise when it comes to personalized medicine and winning the war against antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

I can understand Musk's dislike for the phrase ""nano-"" as it receives undeserved praise, funds, and attention. Most universities are building new facilities to research nano-technology, but there are very few researchers that can legitimately call themselves specialists in the field. As it requires dual-literacy of ""nano"" scale physics and the field you're applying it on. Which 99.999% of researchers don't have due to universities focusing in on very specific fields, thus shunning the broad-minded education that is required to become a ""nano-""(insert specialization here) specialist.

And, while I don't want to attack Ms. Upulie, I do have to admit that it's highly unlikely she has the required background, a B.S. in Molecular Biology, to legitimately call herself a nanobiologist. As up till like 5 years ago no university offered a dual-discipline education in both biology and physics. And the courses that do currently exist have an 80-90% drop-out rate due to how demanding the study is. Become dual-disciplined within 4 years is an astounding feat, and even then it requires a further MSc.  And, while this might sound like something from /r/gatekeeping, if she'd actually had the right credentials she'd be making so much money that she wouldn't need the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/upulie) account to support herself. It's a field that is in desperate need of researchers. Heck, universities would be fighting over her. I certainly would be able to offer her a job. 

---

For those interested in Nanobiology, especially aspiring students, give [David S. Goodsell's book Bionanotechnolgy: Lesson's from Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Bionanotechnology-Lessons-David-S-Goodsell/dp/047141719X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1527316483&sr=1-5&keywords=david+s+goodsell&dpID=41Hw2Ex2dML&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) a read. While it doesn't give you a well-rounded insight of the current field of nanobiology, it does do well as an introduction to the ""nanomachines"" all of us have in our body, and how we could through emulating their machinery provide solutions to many of today's problems.  

For further reading on the topic ""nano"", then I would recommend reading [Drexler's latest book on Nanotechnology](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Abundance-Revolution-Nanotechnology-Civilization-ebook/dp/B06XC791KP/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527316816&sr=8-1&keywords=drexler+nano),  he is one of the people that started the craze by promising a great future back in the 80s. His new book gives a sober perspective to the whole situation, and how the term ""nano""  has been misused and how much research has been mislabeled. 

TL;DR Nanotechnology is a field that has seen more speculation than actual progress. Calling yourself a nanotechnologist is like putting ""Intermediate French"" even if you're only able to say ""Omelette du fromage"". The world needs more researchers that are double-disciplined, one of the requirements to become a ""nanotechnologist"", than it requires science-communicators of which Ms. Upulie is one.

P.S. I'd like to take back calling myself a ""nanobiologist"". Most of us call ourselves biophysicists.  "

He had such a knowledge of technology that he could even keep the rockets he shot into space from crashing. The technology of evs and rockets is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

**Update x2:** It sounds like the rescue of the first 4 kids was [achieved](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/jul/8/wing-inflatables-pods-not-used-during-first-round/) with less traditional means... 2 divers accompanying 1 boy with a full face mask through the water, guided by a rope.

* [Photos and video of the pods being tested](https://www.facebook.com/terri.v.little/posts/10155556175268045)

* They are made by [Wing Inflatables](http://www.wing.com/), a California company that makes all sorts of rugged inflatable boats. 

* [This article](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/jul/7/elon-musks-plane-was-arcata-airport/) has a summary and photos of the jet stopping by.

* [This newspaper article](http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20180706/wing-inflatables-assisting-with-thai-soccer-team-rescue) describes the custom-made pods:

>The pod is made of the same polyurethane the company uses on its boats and pontoons. It’s orange and black and about 7 feet long and 4 feet wide. On one end is a metal ring ropes can be tied to and the other end opens up with Velcro to allow for someone to scoot in with a SCUBA tank. It’s covered in handles to give rescue divers lots of places to grab onto it. On the top, it has four holes that allow for air from the breathing apparatus to escape the pod if less buoyancy is required. The pod has two black pontoons on either side that can be inflated using air from a SCUBA tank for additional buoyancy if needed.

>“They’d climb in and they’d have a breathing apparatus and you could pull them through the submerged part. That’s the big issue with the rescue right now,” Wing general manager Patrick Sproul said.

>Work at the Wing Inflatables factory in Arcata began around 5 a.m. Friday, he said.

>“That’s not our typical start time, but this isn’t a typical situation,” Sproul said.

>By 1 p.m., five employees were testing the first one out in the Arcata Community Pool much to the delight of onlookers including a group of curious Arcata Elementary School children taking part in a summer program.

Once for the [first couple engineers](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1015138953693880320) and the [mockup inflatable subs](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216840498950546&set=pb.1406140291.-2207520000.1531105961.&type=3&theater), now for [sending](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016076907421417472) the [final design](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016063173139427329), and probably sending [another](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016128459054157825) shorter sub soon. That's 3 round trips, or 102 flight hours. Looking at the [operating costs](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2015/november/16/hourly-operating-costs-of-45-jets-compared) of his [G650ER](https://www.private-jet-fan.com/elon-musk-jet.html), that's $4,848/hour or just shy of $500,000 in total. And I'm not even sure if that counts the pilot's time. Not to mention his time spent thinking, talking to divers, and his team's time building and deploying it, materials cost (expensive tubing!), etc. I think he has 9 engineers over there now? 

I'm not _entirely_ sure the team and equipment aren't just flying over there commercially but no matter how you stack it, there's some serious resources being sunk into this. Say what you will about this being a PR stunt but it's certainly not a cheap one. Drop in the bucket for a multi-billionaire but still admirable in my book.

Edit: It's also vaguely possible that all the costs are somehow written off by SpaceX but even then, still noteworthy."

As we all know, Elon has recently tweeted about a British diver being a paedophile. As a native Thai person, it breaks my heart knowing my hero looks down on my homeland as a paedophile swamp. 

Yes, we do have some issues with prostitution, corruption and so forth but it does not mean everyone comes here for that reason. I have a lot of friends from many countries and they are living the normal lives as if they would do back home. 

Thailand is also known for its growing economics with many international businesses, Bangkok is home to many expats from all over the world, hence you always have westerners in Thailand. We have many beautiful places that you can visit, there are beaches, historical sites, small towns and villages where you can experience our culture and traditions, there's many more reason to live in Thailand than just being a creep!

I hope you don't think we are just another third world country with hookers everywhere. Please come and see our country yourself, you are always welcome!

PS; I don't believe the British diver is a pedo, so Elon I'll take the bet, here's my signed 33 Thai baht. (1 USD) 

Sorry for my bad English guys.

23.08.2018: Elon post a [quote in Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1032575096701906944)

*Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. 🖤The Red and The Black♥️*

Possible explanation: The Stendhal quote contrasts two types of love, one 'born of the brain' which is based on shared interests, a knowledge that this is a person I ought to be with since we have so much in common. But this can never be 'true love' which is not based on thought but is instead a spontaneous, wholehearted feeling for another. Since the relationship btw Elon & Grimes started in writing (twitter) concerning shared enthusiasms it is clear Elon thinks it is of the first (brain) type, hence not 'true love'  [source](https://elonmuskfans2.tumblr.com/post/177311758848/the-stendhal-quote-contrasts-two-types-of-love)

25.08.2018: New turn of Azealia's story: in her IG-stories she changed her tone, apologized, wrote the words of support and post her letter from 19.08.2018 to Elon [read letter](https://78.media.tumblr.com/118093f06b70f491852c612325d75a4f/tumblr_pe11q4c7Nf1qewb5f_1280.jpg)

**Addressing the fundamental costs of access to non-surface areas.. and making it 10x to 100x more possible..** 

Of all his accomplishments.  i wonder if the  most remembered impacts will be the exponential change in access to space and access to tunnels. .. getting humans beyond surface living in both directions.

Not to mention his Neural Link work to get us past skin-deep humanity.

I feel like he needs a new pithy title for this.   Elon Musk:

* Anti-Surface Man
* Escape Velocity Man.
* The most 3 dimensional man. 
* 3D Industrialist.
* Exo-surface?
* Trans-surface?
* Trans-dimensional Industrialist \*

I think the last is my favorite so far.

"543","2018-11-18","One story about Elon Musk","**from Quora: Is Elon Musk as humble as the image of him projected to the public?**

**Answer by Troy Allen:** 

""This is purely anecdotal, from a brief fifteen minute interaction with him, but he was nothing but polite and giving of his time when I accidentally met him. I was visiting the Cape Canaveral area, and wanted to go to a “beach bar”. When I walked up, they put a wristband on my arm. Not knowing anything about the bar, I thought maybe it was just to easily know who was “of age” (I am 48).

As I walked in, I noticed a long table full of food. Then I see the following poster board:

[~~Keep calm~~ FREAK OUT We landed on land!](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9c204a8e97162925ffb5133b4ae52428)

Then I looked around, and saw all the SpaceX shirts and realized I was at the “after party” for the first time they recovered a rocket on land. After about 45 minutes, Elon arrived and told everyone what great shape the rocket was in etc. I waited while his actual employees talked to him, took pictures, etc. When my turn came up, I was fully prepared to admit that I did not belong there and was there by accident. But he was talking about the UI in the Tesla, and that is my area of expertise, so I joined in the conversation.

After about 5 minutes, his assistant/security did his job by saying, “It was nice meeting you Troy…” when Elon interrupted him and said, “Hang on - we’re talking here.”

After another 10 minutes or so, we finished up and I asked to get a picture. A woman took it for me, but after I walked away and checked it, it was TOTALLY blurry. I was so disappointed…


[photo](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b1a6877652f2a50f2cced75193c37ab6-c)

As I was walking out, I caught Elon’s eye, and he raised his mug to me (we were both drinking Moscow Mules), and I held up my phone with the blurry picture on it. He yelled, “Get over here, Troy!”, so I worked my way through the group waiting, and he said, “We need to redo that - that sucks”. So he had his assistant take THIS picture, and we checked it this time…

[photo](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2939544a846e46c0bd7f5c31171ea9c3-c)

So yeah, it was just a “celebrity moment” I guess, but he went out of his way both by finishing our conversation AND making sure I had a good picture. Therefore my impression of him is not exactly “humble” in the traditional sense, but he sure was giving of his precious time and attention to me — someone who does not even work for him.""

  He was going on an event on which he met many fans, but I got there a bit late. On my way home, I saw a figure of a young man down the street. When I got closer to him, it was really him! Elon! No bodyguards, not anything! Just him! I got sooo happy and excited when I got the chance to talk to him! I said that I was a huge fan and that it was my dream meeting him! 
   
   After that, we talked about Martian habitation and how it can be accomplished. He gave me advice on what is the best way to habituate Mars and how we should get there! We had a really interesting talk that lasted a few minutes! 

   I never knew that he was so kind and good towards his fans! This was a very exciting encounter and I thought that it was a good idea to post my experience with him here! 

  Actually Rubia_cree inspired me 😁! She is a great person and very positive! Thanks Alice! 

  I am also very interested to hear: Has anyone else in this community ever met Elon? Or at least seen him up close? Thanks for your time!

"212","2019-03-21","Update from the Mod team!","Hi /r/elonmusk!

Recently there were some changes on the mod team that most users on this sub wouldn’t have noticed or tbh probably don’t even care about. What you might have noticed though is a different vibe in “The Musk Lounge” chatroom or the activity around new posts on this sub. So I wanted to address this and share my vision for the sub & the new direction we are heading in.

Firstly, this sub is about Elon Musk. We all know that and that’s why we are here. Some people just learned about Elon and are intrigued by his accomplishments, some people are fans of his work with Tesla & SpaceX and want to support him as a human being, some people have been following & supporting him since the early days when nobody believed in him and some others are just here for the **dank** memes.

And whether you like it or not, this sub is a **Fandom.** A fandom about Elon Musk (the man & his work). But that doesn’t have to be a bad or cringey thing. [Here’s an article](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/psychologists-say-fandoms-are-amazing-for-your-mental-health) talking about how Fandoms can be good for your mental health. lol

Anyways, my point is when it comes to fandoms there is a **fine line between Admiration and Obsession.** This sub started off as a curiosity about Elon and as it grew popular over the last year has turned into obsession. Going forward, the Mod team has taken a decision to consciously choose admiration over obsession and this will reflect in the kind of posts we approve. What this mean is that we will encourage more Original Content such as artwork, rare photos & well written posts that result in good discussions around Elon or his work. Here are some examples of good posts so you know what I am talking about:

\- [My friend got this elon tweet on a mug](https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/b321ki/my_friend_got_this_elon_tweet_on_a_mug/) \[Community OC\]

\- [Elon partying like a rockstar shortly after selling Paypal.](https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/azhk9r/elon_partying_like_a_rockstar_shortly_after/) \[Rare picture\]

\- [Elon Musk pencil and tea 30x21 cm, artist- Oleksii Gnievyschev ( It's me)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/azcj72/elon_musk_pencil_and_tea_30x21_cm_artist_oleksii/) \[Art work\]

\- [I still cannot believe, Elon Musk has accomplished all this at SpaceX just by ‘reading books’ and ‘talking to people’](https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/awwbkl/i_still_cannot_believe_elon_musk_has_accomplished/) \[Discussion\]

\- [Elon Muskular](https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/axtyay/elon_muskular/) \[Dank Meme\]

I am hoping that this sub can be a place where Elon would one day like to do a AMA... to share more about his personal life, his favorite Spotify playlist, watch he is currently watching on Netflix or even his favorite Reddit sub. And the only way (I believe) we can get there, is if we all come together to make this a chill hangout spot for us (and for Elon to lurk) that admires Elon as a man, not obsesses about him as a god.

Let me know your thoughts below. We are always open to new ideas & suggestions."

SpaceX had managed to send Falcon 1 into Space for the first time but was loosing money quick. Now at the end of the decade Elon has managed to transform these companies. Today SpaceX is profitable and cara are coming off the production line faster then ever. SpaceX and their dreams to become multiplanetay is starting to become true with Starship prototype constructed. Elon has also a donated to a lot of charities and used his money for good.

This was to stop welds from splitting when hit by tank shells","Edit: One of the surfaces on SN1 actually has this type of welding and it [survived the explosion](https://youtu.be/U4C0wfRSUNQ?t=208) So it’s pretty clear that it works. (credit to Robert below) 

Back during WWII tanks had a problem with welds splitting when the plates were hit with tank shells. Even if the shell did not enter the tank this would often disable it.

So what the Germans started doing was interlocking the edges of the plates so that the welds had more surface area to transfer the load.

This is most obvious on the Panther tank. 

[Front plates](https://i.imgur.com/Lj5cg7N.png)

[Side plates](https://i.imgur.com/CZNbtfX.png)

Of course, sharp corners on cuts are not compatible with aerospace since the Comet airliner disaster (Cracks develop at the corners of panels and caused explosive decompression in flight), so the “teeth” would need to be rounded to avoid this. It also allows easier welds that can be more continuous than square cuts."

"131","2020-05-01","Reason Behind Musk Tweet on Stock Price","Ok so this is in reference of Elon's Tweet Today: ""Tesla stock price is too high imo""

* This Past Week.
* Why?
* So Why Tweet.
* Legal.

**This Past Week.**

As we know Elon has been very vocal on shelter-in-place orders that have been put in place nationwide tweeting numerous times, this has created two groups, people who are for the shelter-in-place and people who aren't. 

**Why?**

Since the tweeting, people have been believing that Musk is a capitalist and doesn't care about anyone or the pandemic and only money.  They believe that Musk is trying to capitalize on his payday of over $750 million, if Tesla can hold a $100Billion market-cap, this ~~is~~ was on the verge of happening(2-months away) until now. 

**So Why Tweet.**

This seems to be pretty obvious when you look at it, saying ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"" will dump the price of the stock, hopefully going below that $100 billion market cap, ending the 4 out of 6 month streak and restarting the tranches. *This also can show that maybe Musk is speaking his mind, and isn't about the money but his personal views. (Subject to peoples opinions)*

**Legal?**

This is hard, since we don't know. Although this tweet could've been completely legal, even under the SEC Guidelines. The SEC never said that he couldn't tweet about Tesla & Stock, it just said that any tweets must go through a committee to first look over the tweet, if approved he was allow to post the tweet without any legal issues. ([https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/elon-musk-sec-agree-to-guidelines-on-twitter-use/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/elon-musk-sec-agree-to-guidelines-on-twitter-use/))

>U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, the [presiding judge](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/judge-to-sec-and-elon-musk-put-your-reasonableness-pants-on-and-work-this-out/) on this matter, must still approve the deal. Nathan had given the SEC and Musk two weeks to work out their differences and come to a resolution.  
>  
>Musk must seek pre-approval if his tweets include:  
>  
>any information about the company’s financial condition or guidance, potential or proposed mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures,  
>  
>production numbers or sales or delivery number (actual, forecasted, or projected),  
>  
>new or proposed business lines that are unrelated to then-existing business lines (presently includes vehicles, transportation, and sustainable energy products);  
>  
>projection, forecast, or estimate numbers regarding Tesla’s business that have not been previously published in official company guidance  
>  
>events regarding the company’s securities (including Musk’s acquisition or disposition of shares)  
>  
>nonpublic legal or regulatory findings or decisions;  
>  
>any event requiring the filing of a Form 8-K such as a change in control or a change in the company’s directors; any principal executive officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, principal operating officer, or any person performing similar functions"
"161","2020-05-01","I don't think he would be tweeting about Grimes or his baby's due date publicly unless he was hacked or something was wrong. I hope he's ok.",""
"94","2020-05-01","Elon's Tweets - Day 2 | Discussion Megathread","**It's day 2 and Elon is still tweeting.**

It started bright and early around 9 am PST with ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"" tweet.

That was followed by a beautiful rendition of the National anthem:

*""And the rocket's red glare,  the bombs bursting in air.*

*Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.*

*Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave*

*O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?""*

If you thought he was done, well Elon does what elon does. He went on to tweet: ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness""

Next up: he decides he no longer want to own any of his physical possessions, not even his own house. But ""Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilder’s old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any its soul.""

And finally, after several months of rumors about his relationship status with Grimes, he tweets: ""My gf Grimezsz is mad at me"" followed by ""Baby due on Monday"".

Basically, this is Elon Musk's version of ***are you not entertained?!***

This is a discussion thread, so feel free to post your opinions/interpretations of his tweets on this post. Refrain from creating separate opinion posts on this topic, as the subreddit gets flooded by something that can easily be expressed through comments. **Individual opinion posts will be removed.**"

What led you to dedicate your time to forming a personality cult and worshipping and defending a billionare that likely does not give a shit about you and just sees you as another $?

From scrolling through this sub, I see that it's about half random memes, and half straight up cult-like worship (also sometimes in the form of memes). It's like you guys are so shocked that a billionaire understands MEMES XD and ANIME :3, because it's so unbelievable to you that someone as rich and successful as he is is not an evil lizard and that he can like things you like (or pretend to for PR). I hypothesize that this is playing into your psychology. You are probably lost in your lives, you want someone to idolize and look up to, and then you find someone like Elon Musk who seems like a genius and is successful AND shares some of your interests and jokes like the average person? :O

I've been browsing reddit for a while, but I don't think I've seen any other sub have anywhere near the magnitude of circlejerking as this one, any criticism (even non-troll, valid criticism) is instantly mass downvoted or deleted and the poster banned, and then a reply that basically just says ""no elon musk good"" gets mass upvoted. Literally anything negative about Elon Musk is treated like basphemy instead of as a chance to have a civilized discourse, 

I'm not even get into why I think Elon is a shitty person that only acts out of self-interest and an even worse businessman, or talk about how he gets materials sourced from child lab*r, threatens and squashes unions, has dangerous working conditions in his own factories, rushes the production of cars by skipping out on safety checks on things like brakes, spies on and attempts to destroy the lives of people trying to expose his bad practices. Because that's not what this post is about, I just want to know what goes through your mind when you make another meme, write another thread, or write another comment praising daddy Elon?

What's in it for you? What do you gain? What is your motivation for vehemently praising and defending someone who has no clue you exist like he's your God?"

Mainly because animals cannot tell you where they are feeling pain, but neuralink can.

The presentation demonstrated that we can tell exactly when and where a pig's body is moving, and touch sensations. Now expand this to traditional pet microchipping and pain or disease diagnostics.

Getting one of these brain implants in your dog will be faster and cheaper than the surgery to spay or neuter, because a robot can do the entire thing. The chip will be able to tell exactly what organ or body part or region is experiencing pain. The machine learning algorithm may even be able to correlate disease pain and other changes like lyme, distemper, parasites, etc.

Companies like IDEXX with 30+ Billion market cap will have their entire suites of diagnostic tests, hardware, and software made obsolete because you'll get a notification on your phone that your dog has a urinary infection and automatically receive the treatment in the mail. 

I imagine that they'll have implants with a blood spectrometer in the future too."

But something caught my attention the other day that ended in a massive AH HAH moment that I think is a hidden preview of what to come. We all know Elon loves to surprise people - and this is probably on the future docket.

UPDATE: TL/DR: looks like they just filed with SEC for Starlink in moving vehicles. BOOM CALLED IT. 

https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-moving-vehicles-tesla-fcc-application/

I drive a 2020 Model X. I was on the freeway in autopilot just looking at my Robinhood app (safely of course...) and I was waiting for it to load. waiting... and waiting... We all know the internet on a Tesla isn't exactly the best. It's pretty dull to be honest. And then it got me thinking... Why? Why is the internet so bad on a Tesla. Surely Elon has a reason to overlook such a fundamental detail of an otherwise very futuristic car. And then I started down the rabbit hole....

I remembered a series called ""Future Car"" with Neil Degrassi Tyson a few years back and there was this quote that he said that always stuck with me (i'm paraphrasing as best I can here..)...

""In the future - cars will be able to travel within 2 inches of each other at 200 mph... because cars will talk to each other. One car will be able to hit a pot hole in the middle of a lane, and then communicate to a network to the rest of the fleet that a pot hole exists there, and to avoid it. The rest of the fleet can then maneuver safely around it.""

It was at this point then that I looked over at my dashboard and admired the new Tesla update - the fancy schmancy new Suspension update that shows the real time bounce and shock rate of each strut. Man that's a lot of data....

As I looked back at my Robinhood app I remembered for a moment that Elon had recently launched a new round of global satellites for his new company that he is going to be going public with - Starlink. For those not aware - Starlink concept is simple...

Use SpaceX rockets to shoot up 60 satellites at a time in one pay load and create a mass blanket of 600 satellites equally spaced around the entire globe to bring internet to the whole world from up above. Currently he's at about close to 400 sattelites and says the first iteration of the Starlink network is almost live. That's a BIG DEAL...

Currently the Tesla uses integrated software and internal processors hooked up to the cameras to detect the lane markings, road signs, pedestrians, lights, etc. This is internal software all processed within the car. It's for this reason that sometimes when lanes merge the car seems to be drunk with trying to figure out how to make a smooth transition from two lanes to one. It knows where it is, but it doesn't know EXACTLY where it is. It's not confirming by GPS satellite, it's approximating from software.

This is different than say the process for using Siri in your iPhone. When you ask Siri for something, she records it, sends it back to Apple HQ, it is decoded there, then beamed back to your phone, and then the command executed.

The problem right now is that in order for Tesla to be TRULY autonomous (think Robotaxi purposes / Autopilot stability, etc.), the cars will need to improve massively on their accuracy, and it's difficult to do that if you don't have an internal map stored somewhere.

That's when it HIT ME LIKE A BRICK.

The internet in a Tesla sucks and he's not trying to fix it because Elon is already 10 steps ahead of us. He's more than likely going to use the Starlink network to connect the Tesla fleet. GPS data is very limited, so you can only send so much information to a satellite outside of directions. That's why the car currently can't depend on its GPS coordinates to accurately assist the car on everyday popular roads. It simply can't send that large amount of data. But if you had full uninterrupted 1Gig per second Spacelink direct internet that doesn't have any outage anywhere? Imagine the amount of data you can send to the satellite right above you at all times from pretty much every aspect of the car! Suspension data, speed data, driver habits, you can literally route exactly where the car should drive in autopilot primarily through that information, as well as any and all road interruptions can be recorded and shared. Elon's transition to a live alternate version of Westworld is basically complete.

Think about when you play an online MMORPG, like world of warcraft. the game will load all the data in the immediate area so you can play, even as you are moving around,but just beyond your visible view - more data is loading. I feel it would be something like that. Your car would know and be able to share with the tesla network that pot hole you just ran over so the rest can avoid.

&#x200B;

What else do you guys think this would enable? Am I crazy in thinking this? It seems very logical that this is how he would use it."

I thought maybe sharing my thoughts here and listening to feedback might change my mind or at least help me understand better.

So there's no oxygen in Mars right? No atmosphere to block radiation from the sun, and we know now that even the sand on Mars is poisonous to humans. 

There's a whole lot of nothing in every direction, except there may or may not be groundwater on Mars that we may or may not be able to filter for own use.

I also hear a lot of talk about terraforming Mars, but again, it really all just seems like science fiction to me. Assuming that's possible, what's stopping us from using it here on Earth? Humans only make use of around 40% of the land on Earth anyways. There's land we don't inhabit because they are uninhabitable.

Why don't we see Elon or anyone else running colony simulations in the Sahara desert for example? Bir Tawil is especially perfect for that.

These are just my thoughts spilling out so sorry if my points seem a bit random."

You either have to join it and take your seat, or be comfortable where you are. It's just that these people who are born in 100,000 years or of a multiplanetary habitat are going to have course and education that stems way far out of a civilization who only previously had their own academics for 2,000 years. Imagine an actual industrial revolution in 500,000 years, but I think we would need government qualifications to build staples of handicap-support ""aid or environment"" to ripple alongside these more beloved people.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/elon-musk-pitched-the-head-of-yellow-pages-before-the-internet-boom.html

In 1995, just before the dot-com bubble began, Elon Musk believed “the internet was definitely about to go supernova,” he recalled on the Third Row Tesla podcast in January.

And as a result, Elon decided to build a web start-up called Zip2, with which he and his brother Kimbal Musk aimed to create an online version of the Yellow Pages phone book (which was an actual book at the time). Zip2 made business directory data searchable and mapped it, so users could get door-to-door directions to businesses.

The brothers had partnered with newspapers (listing classifieds online and things of that sort) to generate revenue, but they wanted to expand the business by partnering with the Yellow Pages.

Newscast | UIG | Getty Images “I remember talking to the head of the [company] that owned the Yellow Pages [in Canada],” Kimbal said on the Third Row Tesla podcast. “We said, ‘We want to partner with you. Let’s be one of your partners to put the Yellow Pages online.’

“And [the executive] picked up the Yellow Pages – this book, this big thick book full of ads, this multibillion-dollar risk industry – and threw it at me and said, ‘You ever think you’re going to replace this?’”

But the response was a typical one at the time, as “most businesses didn’t know what the internet was” back then, Elon said on the podcast. “Most people didn’t have an email address or ever went online.”

Maye Musk tweets pic of her, Kimbal & Elon at Zip2.

“At that point, very few people were in the internet [business], so it was really a question of, ‘Is the internet going to succeed?’ Which we were huge believers in, and these guys were not.”

When Elon and Kimbal would try to get funding or partner with other companies, they were forced to explain the internet.

“We said like, ‘Listen, it costs very little. You’ll still own all the content and everything.’ And they’d just throw us out of the office, [saying] ‘No. How dare you even suggest this,’ Elon said.

“And we were like ‘OK, I guess we’ll just build it.’”

Zip2 ultimately won over The New York Times, Knight Ridder and Hearst Corporation, who not only partnered with Zip2 but together invested a total of $50 million in the business, according to Ashlee Vance’s book, “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.”

In 1999, Elon and Kimbal reportedly sold Zip2 for roughly $300 million and Elon used that money on a second start-up X.com, which later became PayPal. In 2002, eBay purchased PayPal for $1.5 billion.

Elon went on to start SpaceX in 2002, and became a Tesla investor in 2004 and CEO in 2008. In 2016, he founded Neuralink, and a year later, he created The Boring Company.

In 2004, Kimbal shifted industries and co-founded The Kitchen Restaurant Group, which owns three farm-to-table restaurant chains: Next Door, The Kitchen and Hedge Row. He also owns indoor farming company Square Roots and started foundation Big Green, which teaches farming to children.

Kimbal invested in and serves on the boards of Tesla and SpaceX.

Today, Elon Musk is worth $225 billion, according to Forbes."

**Tesla lies & misinformation, common misconceptions**

""Elon is not a co-founder and stole Tesla from Eberhard""

[Nafnlaus explains why Elon is a co-founder](https://twitter.com/enn_nafnlaus/status/1315375076460691456)

""Elon sued Eberhard to be declared a co-founder""

[Actually it was Eberhard who sued to be declared one of two Tesla founders but lost in court.](https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-musk-gloats-over-eberhard-ruling/)

[A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders](https://www.fastcompany.com/1367866/tesla-lawsuit-drama-ends-five-company-founders-emerge)

&#x200B;

[Tesla coup in Bolivia](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/elon-musk-confesses-to-lithium-coup-in-bolivia-20200725-0010.html) is another common lie spread by MSM because Elon made a joke last year ""[We will coup whatever we want deal with it!](https://twitter.com/panoparker/status/1318157559266762752).

But what they don't realize is that Lithium in Bolivia [contains too much magnesium for it to be worthwhile for Tesla to invest there.](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/07/26/tesla-battery-materials-production-lithium-nickel-sourcing/) Tesla get's their [Lithium from Australia](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286867520314642443?lang=da)

&#x200B;

**Tesla subsidies**

[This article](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html) is shared a lot on social media to somehow discredit Elon however it's complete bogus and full of misinformation

Tesla has received [$2.5bn in total](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/tesla-inc) However the $750m subsidy for Giga New York is misleading because Tesla does not own that factory it belongs to the state.

Tesla buyers also received a tax credit for the first 200k cars produced (this expired in 2019). That adds another $billion even though it didn't directly support Tesla it does allow them more margins for their cars.

So that's no more than $2.8 billion in subsidies which pales in comparison to when you realize how much the Fossil fuel industry gets [$423 billion every year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/world-spends-423-billion-a-year-to-subsidize-fossil-fuels-un.html) and other legacy automakers [GM](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/general-motors) & [Ford](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/ford-motor) who receives twice and triple the amount of Tesla.

Another lie you might hear often on social media is [""Tesla was bailed out by the government""](https://twitter.com/lindyli/status/1453077856666497028) with $465M loan from the Department of Energy back in 2009.

This is false it was actually [Daimler who saved Tesla back in 2009 with a $50m investment.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/daimler-saved-tesla-paved-way-174343218.html) The $465M loan from the government was not awarded until 2010 when the financial crisis had already passed.

Also it's important to note that Tesla repaid that loan [9 years early](https://www.wired.com/2013/05/tesla-pays-off-fed-loans/) with interest

Ford received a similar $6bn loan at the same time and has [yet to repay](https://eu.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2020/07/29/ford-government-loan-department-energy-debt/5526413002/)

&#x200B;

**SpaceX subsidies.**

SpaceX received [$5million](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/space-exploration-technologies-spacex) plus [$15 million](https://www.space.com/26755-spacex-texas-private-spaceport.html) from Texas to start developing Starship at Boca Chica. They also won [$900 million in FCC subsidies to bring internet to rural areas](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/spacex-starlink-wins-nearly-900-million-in-fcc-subsidies-auction.html) which will be distributed over the next 10 years.

So yes Tesla & SpaceX has both received subsidies but this myth that Elon is relying on government funding is complete bogus. So here is a few examples of what Elon has/will save the taxpayers & government and show he is actually a massive net gain that has already saved NASA tens of billions.

This is not even counting how much Starship will be saving the government in the future.

[NASA estimates having SpaceX build spacecraft for astronauts saved $20 billion to $30 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/nasa-estimates-having-spacex-and-boeing-build-spacecraft-for-astronauts-saved-up-to-30-billion.html)

[SpaceX saves NASA 3 billion with lunar lander.](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2021/04/26/blue-origin-dynetics-fighting-nasas-selection-of-spacex-for-human-moon-landing-system/)

[SpaceX saves NASA at least 1.5 billion with Europa Clipper mission](https://wccftech.com/nasa-saves-1-5-billion-by-choosing-spacex-for-628-million-kilometer-journey/)

[SpaceX saves NASA at least 30 million per seat to ISS.](https://catalyst.independent.org/2020/06/04/spacex-launch-private-space-race/)

&#x200B;

**Hyperloop**

A common misconception we hear often is Elon building a hyperloop, this is false it's actually Richard Branson & Josh Giegel (CEO) [Virgin Hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Hyperloop) who is perusing this idea. Elon wrote a Hyperloop Alpha paper back in 2013 and held an annual Hyperloop pod competition from 2015–2019 in which a number of student and non-student teams participated. Elon abandoned the project for whatever reason and The Boring Company is not involved with Hyperloop.

The Boring Company is building a ""[tunnel loop](https://www.boringcompany.com/loop)"" which is basically just electric cars in tunnels. (TBC) have already built the [(LVCC) loop](https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc) with [fantastic success](https://www.teslarati.com/the-boring-company-lvcc-loop-ces-2022-results-review/) and has recently gained [approval](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-expand-strip/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG8WMo3NwglM7qf5H_8pHYH1Ampbgad84pseDsug5t0gwlrLfyG9jZcl5vm6c76WkClQXVFEG_YvP1xVa3l1EiNs5DoRzO6-4JkUjjwOnephjoWFWLl13IW120ROCqhEwo-mpyr_k6wU9iqnr63Vmd5aAiBbs5nf9Ui1p93dDJj0) for the construction of ""[The Vegas Loop](https://www.boringcompany.com/vegas-loop)""

**Common Misconceptions about Starlink**

You often hear people having concerns about orbital debris and [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)

But in actuality everything in LEO is self-cleaning. [Tory Bruno explains why here.](https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1407747990287171587) Starlink satellites operate at 550km attitude so none of them are in any danger of causing orbital debris, all Starlink satellites are equipped with deorbiting technology and will deorbit automatically after their lifespan of 5-7 years.

However there is some valid concerns about satellite collision as more and more satellites are deployed, SpaceX has made great effort to address this issue as all their satellites have anti collision technology.

**FUD and lies about Autopilot & FSD Beta. Please note FSD Beta & Autopilot is not the same thing.**

Here is a few FUD articles with no data to back it up

&#x200B;

**FSD Beta**

[Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" Beta Is Just Laughably Bad and Potentially Dangerous](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35878363/teslas-full-self-driving-beta-is-just-laughably-bad-and-potentially-dangerous/)

[San Francisco Authorities Voice Concerns About Safety Record Of Tesla’s FSD Beta Rollout](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/09/san-francisco-authorities-voice-concerns-about-safety-record-of-teslas-fsd-beta-rollout/)

Since FSD (beta) released last year it has yet to be involved in any [accidents](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439042334155497474).

Important to note this would never slip under the medias attention.

&#x200B;

**Autopilot**

[Tesla Says Autopilot Makes Its Cars Safer. Crash Victims Say It Kills.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/05/business/tesla-autopilot-lawsuits-safety.html)

[A life and death question for regulators: Is Tesla's Autopilot safe?](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/life-death-question-regulators-is-teslas-autopilot-safe-2021-09-21/)

Here is some [actual data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/10/28/new-tesla-autopilot-statistics-show-its-almost-as-safe-driving-with-it-as-without/?sh=651e70011794) from last year that shows Tesla AP is on par with humans, without taking into consideration the improvements AP has made over the last year.

&#x200B;

**Elon does not pay his fair share of taxes.**

Mainstream media often attack Elon for not paying taxes and article like these are pretty common.

[Elon Musk Paid $0 in Federal Income Tax in 2018](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-paid-0-in-federal-income-tax-in-2018-report-1847051810)

However they deliberately left out the reason why which was [Elon overpaid his taxes in 2017](https://youtu.be/MGonhdN3Rfs?t=130)

Elon has paid [\~$11 billion](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/20/investing/elon-musk-11-billion-dollars-taxes/index.html) in taxes in 2021 (at a 53% tax rate) due to $TSLA stock options expiring in 2022. [Elon explains more here](https://youtu.be/MGonhdN3Rfs)

&#x200B;

**Tham Luang cave rescue** **controversy**

I think everyone knows what Elon said was inexcusable, however i think it's important to understand this whole situation from Elon's perspective.

I recommend everyone to [read this](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-full-story-behind-Elon-Musks-involvement-with-the-Thai-cave-rescue-effort/answer/Jeremy-Arnold-4)

"117","2022-04-17","About the growing anti-Musk mentality out there","Before he was a multi-billionaire there was none of the bullshit that we see today. Just a risk-taking and eccentric tech guy who took a gamble on the EV market when everyone else thought he was kind of nuts. Then he started SpaceX, and Tesla grew some value in line with a vague sense of its promise. His net worth then hovering between 10 and 20 billion for a period before the eventual boom of the past year.

That’s when the idiocracy started, though it was probably there earlier for the few of the few who paid any attention. First sign I saw was a couple years back, this article written by some hard-left journalist that said Musk had gone into the EV industry purely to make a profit. 

Nowadays that kind of slant seems moderate. Just check the comments section of any post on r/all where Musk is mentioned. Forget the once-in-a-millenia genius who’s single handedly revolutionised sustainable energy and given the species the optimism of a multiplanetary future, the relatable nerd with the lax sense of humour, the awkwardly stuttering CEO who’s clearly as sincere as they come – fuck that, the hordes now say. His ascent to the top of the wealth pool proves that he’s the epitome of  egocentric capitalist greed, not a care for the common man, worse than Bill Gates in the 90s and Larry Ellison today. Just another Steve Jobs who takes credit for the hard work of overworked engineers he’ll never properly compensate.

Nevermind the depth of his problem solving and the even greater depth of his engineering expertise, the creative lead he’s taken in every major advent of both his largest companies. That he’s more than Eddison ever was, perhaps closer to Tesla himself in terms of his ingenuity. That he taught himself advanced rocket sciences to a level that allowed him to pioneer the entire industry, and used a first principles methodology that made countless far-reaches not just possible, but likely.

The phenomenon of the blind dissent out there doesn’t say much that’s good about us at a psych level. People see the net worth, they see the spat he had with Sanders, they see other people talking shit, they talk shit themselves. Zero research done, just another rich asshole with an entitlement problem. Led now by a media who champion the same fallacy, who all but ignored the insane tax figure he voluntarily paid, the good he’s put into the world, that his wealth is in direct proportion with the value he’s created. That even though our civilisation is headed towards an environmental catastrophe, the greedy CEO they love to hate has managed to minimise that inevitable disaster more than every other conservationist in history put together. 

Whenever I see some kneejerk comment, this, is what goes through my head. The intelligencia of the world seem less persuaded than the media are, but a strange time when the masses who haven’t followed Musk are heading towards such a hostile consensus. 

Does any of this actually matter? No. Probably not. But that doesn’t change the black mirror it places on us all, even us, the ones who see Musk for the revolutionary he really is. Our prejudices may not be with him, but they must be somewhere. Best we can do is remain as reasonable as we can, stick to the science, stick to a logical reasoning no matter the emotions involved. 

When we finally reach Mars, when solar reaches its potential, when every automaker is selling more EVs than diesel and gasoline standards, maybe then Musk will get a broader understanding. Till then, to anyone who reckons he’s doing all this “for the profit” who happens to read this, no offence, but maybe take a few moments to reflect on the future of a world without Musk in it, and, depending on the conclusion you come to, take a step back, head to the nearest bathroom, grab a moist towel, and then go fuck yourself, vigorously, with the wide-tip of a rusty diesel exhaust."

So if you try to take a look at the Elon Musk wikipedia page you will find that the people maintaining it obviously have tried wherever possible to paint Elon in as negative a light as possible.

Phrases like: ""Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial statements."" and ""Another described him as exhibiting total and complete pathological sociopathy"" and MANY more negative quotes spread throughout the article.

I have been following the article for a while and it looks like that a person by the name of Qrep2020 has the main control over what edits are allowed and what is rolled back. And if we take a closer look at this user he is the creator of the TESLAQ (shortsellers in Tesla) article on Wikipedia and primary contributor. So he most likely is biased to paint Elon and Tesla in as bad a light as possible.

Wikipedia should be unbiased - but the article on Elon is anything but that.

Is there something that can be done?

We can easily put other billionaires like Bill, Warren, Jeff, etc. in the same box. But it's obvious Elon doesn't exactly fit in with that crowd all the time. At the same time, he's obviously no commoner and therefore can't be categorized into any popular subcultures, even if it's a subculture he perfectly understands. And at the same time he is significant enough that you can love or hate him, but you can't ignore him.

As a child he was bullied, but he gets no sympathy since he was born into wealth. He admits he is on the autism spectrum, but again he gets no understanding from the public because he's tremendously rich. 

I think a lot of people hate Elon because they simply don't know what to do with him. What part of him do we accept and which part do we reject? He's an incredibly eccentric, loud, innovative, genius who somehow manages to be totally out of touch sometimes yet entirely in touch other times. It's really hard to know how to feel about someone so unique, a lot of people would rather either see him as the hero of the free market or as everything wrong with capitalism. He lives in people's heads rent free and it's very difficult to kick him out.

We are seeing tons of new accounts come to this sub only with this type of behavior. We are no longer going to allow this. This is Rule 3. That user is more than the normal seagull that swoops in poops one thing then leaves. This user made more comments then that screenshot shows.

I hate politics, but its happening and we are seeing a lot of in the sub because of what Elon is saying/doing. We have seen a big increase in a few things, one is, Liberal Democrats coming to the sub to dump on everything (as you can see above in that users comments via the screenshot). Then we get the Conservative Republicans fighting and it's just ugly.  Another thing we are seeing stand out in the past weeks are [social justice warriors](https://imgur.com/a/crjAsFQ)*.* The last thing we are seeing, are users from certain subreddits come here to create toxicity, these users and the SJWs are the worse. 

This is what we are going to do about it. **You can help by using that report button.** We have new mods and we are working on bots to deal with all the above. If you happen to get banned and it doesn't make any sense, please reach out to modmail. If you do not hear back this is because the ban was justified."

The vast majority of comments I get from folks here on Reddit are as follows: a) Elon knew Twitter had a bot problem, b) Elon waived due diligence, and c) the double-counting of users wasn’t material. This dialog can be found on my original post [HERE](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/elon-musks-devastating-response-to).

&#x200B;

>ELON MUSK: The bot problem on Twitter is out of control. If you could get a handle on the bot problem the user experience could be improved 1000%! It should be doable since bots only represent <5% of overall users. Will you sell me your company for $44 billion dollars?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: We’re concerned you aren’t serious and that you won’t close. How can we be sure you’ll close after spending the next few months kicking the tires?  
>  
>ELON MUSK: What if I waived completion of due diligence as a condition of close?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: That would go a long way. How about you pay us $1 billion if you decide not to close. Oh, and you’d need to personally guarantee the $1 billion dollars if you use a worthless shell company to buy the company.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: $1 billion? Hm. Okay, but I will need at least six months to conduct diligence. You’ll need to agree to give me everything I’ll need to conduct my diligence including financial information and user data. Why don’t we say a six-month diligence period?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Okay but what if you find something you don’t like during diligence?  
>  
>ELON MUSK: If it is just something I don’t like I’d still be required to close. How about we outline reason/events that would justify my termination of the deal? What about your SEC filings? Are they all accurate?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Yes. They are all accurate as of January 1, 2022.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Great. How about you represent and warrant that everything in your SEC filings is true and accurate as of January 1, 2022. Over the next six months we’ll conduct our due diligence to confirm the accuracy of the information you’ve provided to the SEC so that we can provide that to our fellow equity investors and lenders - $44 billion is a lot of money so everyone involved will need to do due diligence to feel comfortable closing - the banks will certainly require it as a condition of funding. Okay, so lets plan on closing in November.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Sounds great. Lets sign the deal.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Okay, so you’re sure everything in your SEC filings is accurate?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Yes. Please sign the Merger Agreement Elon. Oh and you can’t Tweet mean things about me.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: I can’t Tweet mean things? I’ll need a discount Parag! I’ll only Tweet my opinions and I won’t disparage you (i.e. by Tweeting things I know to be false). I just faxed you the merger agreement.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Ug. I’m not sure we have a fax machine.  
>  
>\[THREE DAYS LATER\]  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Parag, you just restated the number of users you’ve reported to the SEC for three years - you admit that you overstated the number of users you have in twelve-straight quarterly SEC filings. [The restated 10-Q filed with the SEC today shows that you’ve been **double-counting** users.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23046170/twitter-miscounted-daily-users-three-years-q1-2022-earnings) Just three days ago you signed an agreement with me to sell Twitter representing that the information you’ve provided to the SEC is accurate! You didn’t say anything about this Parag. What is going on?  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Elon, it isn’t a big deal. It is just a legal thing we had to do. It isn’t material so it doesn’t count.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: WTF! Isn’t material? We signed this deal three days ago and you didn’t mention that you’d be restating your user numbers with the SEC admitting you’ve been double counting the number of users for three years! That is a big deal Parag. You’ve literally already busted one of the very few REPRESENTATIONS I insisted on when we signed this deal THREE DAYS AGO. And we’re talking about millions of users per quarter. Damn it Parag.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Elon how can I fix this?  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Okay we need to dig into your user numbers. How you count them. How you determine how many are bots. Etc.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: No problem. We basically have a few people we hire on a contract basis to select 100 users at random and they determine what percentage are bots - they always tell us that the number of bots they find represent <5% of our total users. Does that help?  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Are you shitting me? You’ve got more than 100 engineers who are experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning and they haven’t built you tools that give you a real-time accounting of users? Instead you rely on a part-time worker you contract to analyze 100 accounts as the basis for you SEC filing that <5% are bots? First, I don’t beleive you. Second, if it is true you literally have no idea how many real users you have. Okay, I will get my data experts to dig in. We will need your user data in real-time so we can built the AI/ML tools you should have already built to count the users.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: Okay we can give you our firehose but it won’t have the data you need. We won’t give you the data you need to do the sort of analysis that you want to do. But you still need to give us $44 billion.  
>  
>ELON MUSK: Screw you. You are in breach of the Merger Agreement.  
>  
>\[31 DAYS LATER\]  
>  
>ELON MUSK: The Merger Agreement gave you 30 days to cure your breach of the Merger Agreement. I count at least four different breaches of the Merger Agreement - none of which you have cured per the terms of the agreement. Given the fact that YOU breached the agreement you’ll need to pay me the $1 billion breakup fee - oh and yes, I’m not buying your company.  
>  
>PARAG AGRAWAL: No. You have to close no matter what. None of our breaches of the Merger Agreement were ‘material’. Just minor breaches. You have to buy us. I want out of here.

No money for working class families = No more children.

Working class people are under valued as their work is seen as mindless and dispensable to those who are extremely ambitious and influential. If you didn't achieve your dream, then you must be a lazy peasant. Now you must work as a clerk at the grocery store where no one will appreciate a thing you do after calling your work meaningless because it doesn't compare to that of an astrophysicist. Guess you just didn't play the game right and take advantage of all those opportunities when you should have huh?

Family life is portrayed as boring and tedious and not something that is lucrative. 

The average blue collar worker makes very little to support a family. Mostly all people working have blue collar jobs. 

Debt = depression. Most people accumulate debt right out of university because they are influenced to take a loan so they can fulfill their ""maximum potential"" as a human being for fear they are left behind. This only contributes to high medication usage. People even medicate just to get themselves through school. Adderall anyone? 

High prices = people cant afford to have kids / cant take on the ""burden"" of a family. Burden being the key word here. 

pregnancy is often seen as a consequence for young career oriented women. Not your fault. Gotta keep up in this crazy world! 

high rise in mental illness = more fear and anxiety in our communities = lack of faith and hope for the future. 

Nihilism at an all time high.

Why bring people into the world if you don't see humans as anything other than a planet destroying disease? What will you be leaving these children when they live in water world?

This idea is foolish for many reasons, to list a few:

1) All Putin has to do, is to settle the areas with his people and kill the pro-Ukrainian citizens (what a great incentive to give to a maniac). 

2) Dangerous precedent of Larger countries invading neighbors and demanding Referendums, or just pressuring the world into letting them annex new territories through Nuclear blackmail. 

3) Nukes suddenly become a key component in Foreign affairs, which will of course increase investments in this technology in many nations. Here’s the question: Will this path increase or decrease the chances of Nuclear war? 

4) Millions of people have been driven out of their homes from the occupied territories. Any type of referendum would be a sham. 

5) Musk misunderstands the core of the conflict here. It is not Crimea, nor is it Donbas or “Russian speaking minorities”. The game Putin is playing is to rebuild the Russian Empire. There is no end to this, until it is stopped by force. Many westerners don’t understand this. You are not doing Ukraine a favor by supporting them, Ukraine is doing a favor to you by spilling their own blood stopping Putin, so you don’t have to in the future. And make no mistake, just like Hitler never stopped at Czechoslovakia or Austria, neither will Putin stop at Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. 

6) If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, this will trigger a second Cold War in the world and I doubt that either common people or Elon’s companies will be doing particularly well in this scenario."

All you'd need to do is watch him on a recent podcast to see all he wants to do is make life better for humanity. 

So why all the Elon hate? I've watched the general opinion of reddit change so drastically over the last year or so. My friend, who also liked Elon, said he's beginning to change his opinion. I asked him what changed in the last year and he said he didn't know. I think reddit is a great platform for warping the opinion of the masses.

Federal minimum wage is currently sitting at $7.25 an hour in the U.S. and if you worked a full time 40 hour a week job that roughly translates to around $15,080 a year.

If you never rose above that wage you would end up making $633,360 in 42 years, which is the average amount of time a person tends to work in U.S. currently.

At that rate Elon could have paid the entire life time of 69,470 workers wages, that's nearly the entire population of Canton Ohio.

1. I have never worked for Twitter and outside of running into some of their folks in conferences, I have no direct knowledge of anyone there.
2. I am not interested in speculating what will be the future of the platform, I am just seeing a huge amount of misinformed opinions and I thought I can offer my perspective as someone who has worked on large-scale systems their whole career.

Cool?

Alright so let's start with a comment on Twitter being bloated. I have no knowledge of their organizational structure and I think it's a safe assumption to say that neither most people commenting one way or another. I can say with certainty that Twitter did not have 7500 engineers. Probably less than half of that number were involved in anything directly technical, and the rest were supporting and business departments (like marketing, legal, compliance, support, vendor and customer relations, HR, training, etc. etc.).

Several thousand people may seem a lot until you realize the scope of this operation. This is a global company with datacenters around the world. I would guess 3 in the US ~~(minimally 2 West and East) and minimally 1 in Europe, 1 in India and at least 1 in Asia maybe Singapore...If they had a presence in China they would also have at least a dedicated datacenter there too.~~

`Edit: I know no one comes back to read these things, but for the sake accuracy I looked up Twitter's infrastructure and from what I can find they have 3 physical datacenters in the US and contracts with AWS and Google(GCP).` 

The technical groups would also be separated into specialists. Frond-end development is fundamentally different than backend development which is fundamentally different than operations such as network and infrastructure. Those teams would also split into specialists for each platform. Android, iOS and browser would have their own dedicated teams, probably multiple of each as the engineers are also rarely experts in UIX for example. There would be multiple teams dedicated to analytics for business and operational purposes staffed with data scientists. Security definitely had its own organization with perhaps also divided between security development and security operations. How large each organization was would depend on how much custom security solutions they developed vs. using known products.

For every critical function and interface, ideally you need separate teams and people for both security and speed. You cannot rely on a single person for a critical function because things happen to people...they get sick, they get hit by busses, they have kids, they might even want to go on vacation.

I can go on, however the point I wanted to make is that it's not so simple throwing numbers around about how many people are needed to both run and enhance that platform. Maybe the layoffs and resignations were even across everything, maybe they were only targeted for certain teams. If the numbers are indeed upwards of 80 to 90% across all teams, then the development speed and perhaps operational stability may be at risk, even if there are still people who can handle each are, if they are the only ones left with their expertise, it's a huge risk to the organization. You never want to be one-deep on any given area.

I won't go into much of the discussion about twitter still being the same since the layoffs because that's just silly. The people working there weren't hamsters on wheels that once they left the wheels would immediately stop spinning. The clues about the health of the systems will be revealed in the coming weeks and months. In operations when the next outage happens. We will see the root cause and how long it will take to resolve. In security, same deal. In development we will see how new features are rolled out and whether they are buggy, etc. and of course in the long run we will see how those things are addressed and whether they are improving.

=============================

On the technical side there is just a tsunami of bad takes from ""put it on the cloud"" to ""this is a simple app"" and I feel that they fall into fundamentally 3 categories of people (if I exclude those who are trolling):

1. Non-IT people making comments from their experience as a user
2. IT people who haven't worked on globally large-scale systems
3. Non-Technical IT people who may have worked on large-scale systems but from a management perspective or never had to solve for the engineering problems at that scale.

This topic alone could fill a dozen books, but let me just say that any simple operation scaled to several billion operations per hour across the globe is not trivial to solve and will break in very unexpected ways. There are also counter-intuitive scenarios where systems which are optimized for speed at that scale will actually become **slower** if the call volume is decreased. There isn't a single person or skillset which can solve this on their own, you need deep experts in network, in storage, in cashing, in several specific RFCs and this isn't something that is taught in schools because it's only useful for less than 100 companies worldwide. It's actually a huge testament to the geniuses who came up with the original specifications for things like HTTP because they never envisioned in their wildest dreams how the internet would evolve and the fact these protocols have been able to (mostly) scale to this level is honestly mind-blowing. It's like if the Wright Brothers' initial engine design could be used almost unchanged in today's fighter jets.

`Edit: One more edit here since I got called out on my tech geekiness and I didn't have a chance to respond to that comment before the user deleted it. There are indeed different kinds of network experts and I don't pretend to be a network engineer, I have to call on the adults when it comes to WAN specific considerations.` 

`Also, when I mention expertise in RFCs I was just simplifying because no one is interested in reading another 4 paragraphs on how do you go about designing and implementing a custom solution based on an RFC specification while also being aware of the 19 other vendors who have done the same but all in slightly different ways and will sit there and play dumb when you tell them that actually they aren't spec compliant since they aren't including an attribute that is marked as MANDATORY by the spec.`

This is already a huge wall of text so I don't want to geek out over the technical section (I am happy to if anyone has questions in the comments), but I wanted to especially call this out for my IT brothers and sisters because some of these comments make you look foolish to those with experience in these fields."

If so,  I am afraid this community will become a toxic cespol for trolls to thrive in, as this wave of Elonhaters seems to gain momentum.

I know I am being naive, but I wish for a forum for like minded people to share comments and post about Elon in a respectful way, sure, open criticism too, we all know that Elon is only human and does stupid thing too. 

But the level of hatred, nonsensical criticism towards anything Elon related is just going over the charts, and what was once a subreddit about Elon for the fan base and regulars becomes no longer.

To avoid this, maybe we should appeal to the moderators to look into it and see what could be done, if anything at all.

Any suggestions?"

Twitter's buyout has triggered a change in discussion around Musk himself, and as a result, the tone of the subreddit. We're making this post to let you know our goals and how we're working towards them.

***""I miss the way the subreddit used to be.""***

So do we. Strictly speaking the ideal tone of the subreddit is *an approximation of balance.* Even if that balance is impossible, we'd be more than happy returning to the *tone* the subreddit used to have before roughly November. For someone new to the subreddit, they have no idea what that tone was and likely have a different idea of what it should be, and that's alright, because we'll try to explain what you should expect in this post, at least for the time being. For people familiar with the sub before the change in tone due to the influx of guests, we say this to you: we're sorry this place has been so negative. We really are. We're reading the posts you make about this place ""going to shit"" as if our hands are off the wheel and we promise this change in tone has happened in spite of our concerted efforts. 

Despite aggressive moderation well in excess of what any of us are comfortable with, the bad actors keep things off balance such that we still see daily posts by people telling us this is just another hate sub and we're not doing anything. We'll hold the L on that one if you'll be patient a while longer as we continue to course correct back to how this place was *for years* before the Twitter Era. There were goofy memes, moderate effort art posts, in-jokes, and decent debate. Things could be jovial, but when they got serious, it wasn't repulsive to read. I promise you want we that back and have been working hard to get it there. We've let you down, but I promise it's not from lack of action. 

***""Rich Man Bad! Let me criticize him!""***

Please do! With our solicitation and blessings! We *want* you to hold him accountable, and especially in this place that uses his name. But we want it to be polite, and in good faith. Not a whole lot of you have been either of those things lately. The ideal we're striving ~~to return to~~ for is that this place is casual. Right now, it's definitely not casual or comfortable, and that means moderation is going to (continue to) be heavy-handed for as long as it takes for us to get the tone as it was. We can get there through less 4chan-tier driveby smearing and more classroom debate. We want debate! That means criticism of Musk, and not even necessarily in equal measure to praise, as that ship has, for the time being, sailed into the West. 

But to get the sub back to what it was in *tone* it means we're clamping down hard on low effort anti-Musk sentiment, as that is overwhelmingly what we're seeing these past few months, and overwhelmingly from accounts with no established posthistory here yet with posthistories that include frequent use of anti-Musk subreddits with 4chan-tier abuse. Honestly, some day, we'd like to get back to a sub where seeing that kind of awful but short comment wouldn't have us bat an eye, because it's not the norm, it's an outlier that can be overlooked. We're not close to being that subreddit again, not yet.

If we were in the hypothetical that Reddit didn't have numerous places in which to say heinous shit about Musk with no qualms about said shit's connection to reality, we'd likely be more sympathetic to the sentiment and the desire to smear the walls with it. But we're not in that hypothetical, and it's not what this place was about as recently as October. We want to see people dropping well-reasoned explanations for why abruptly banning those journalists for location doxxing was or wasn't a good idea without having to read yet another reality-inoculated conspiracy or seeing someone being told they must know how many hairs are on Musk's nuts because they had the *sheer fucking hubris* to provide rebuttal to criticism directed at Musk. 

Go elsewhere to whine about some pedo's island, or emerald mines or your spontaneous fascination with the limits of frozen peaches on public websites. In the short and moderate terms, this isn't where you're going to have those conversations no matter how vehemently you protest in modmail after you feign ignorance. If you *are* one of those people, you're in luck: you won't have to look long to find subs where you're welcome to make those posts and comments on this here reddit dot com.

***""How will enforcement be changing?""***

It won't, actually; the changes happened months ago. Automod catches *just so much actual pondscum* every single day already. In the pursuit to get this place just how it was, not the saccharine-sweet, white-padded pavilion our modmail has been full to bursting with accusations of from the new anti-Musk types flooding in, we've already put forward some of the most strict moderation ever seen for a subreddit. This topic is just the warning we didn't give before and probably should have. We're hoping with a bit of pre-emptive stick waving we can reduce how often we have to use it. Beware of dog.

***""I think I was banned unfairly.""***

Reach out in modmail. All the recent additions to mods were primarily to fish good eggs out of the automod grinder. It sucks, but the *tiny fraction* of innocents getting caught are well worth aggressive filters, we assure you. If you're at all unsure about your ban's legitimacy, and you read this sticky, you were banned for good reason, and should not reach out. The vast majority of our modmail is people reaching out in bad faith because they want to be allowed to throw shit. This isn't a bathroom. Criticism good, ""he's a literal Nazi"" substantially less good. For the tiny few of you who do feel slighted unfairly, even those of you with histories critical of Musk, reach out, *politely*, and we'll get you sorted with our apologies.

***""I want to help.""***

What is wrong with you? Actually, don't bother, we still want your help. Do you share a desire to bring the subreddit as it existed before November back? Do your goals for this subreddit align closely with what was said here? Do you not moderate any other subreddits? Then reach out in modmail. Please god free us from this vermilion hellscape."

> Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election. Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!

> Let me explain: if even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, something that the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible, that would be about 2 million new legal voters in 4 years. 

> The voting margin in the swing states is often less than 20 thousand votes. That means if the “Democratic” Party succeeds, there will be no more swing states!! 

> Moreover, the Biden/Harris administration has been flying “asylum seekers”, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona. It is a surefire way to win every election. 

> America then becomes a one-party state and Democracy is over. The only “elections” will be the Democratic Party primaries. This already happened in California many years ago, following the 1986 amnesty.

> The only thing holding California back from extreme socialism and suffocating government policies is that people can leave California and still remain in America. Once the whole country is controlled by one party, there will be no escape.

> But I came to a conclusion that we are at a fork in the road of the destiny of America, of the Western world and perhaps of Civilization as a whole, because I saw erosion of freedom of speech, the right to bear arms and the constitution generally, and the oppressive nature of the Federal government getting worse every year. And then there's this whole open borders thing which is just total madness. 

> I was hearing one story after another of friends of mine that were being violently assaulted and robbed. And it'd been getting way worse every year. My mom used to walk around New York a few years ago without fear, and now three of her friends have been assaulted and nobody even got arrested. Now she only walks her dog inside of her apartment building. I hear these stories from many, many people. There's hardly a downtown in America that's safe to walk in.
