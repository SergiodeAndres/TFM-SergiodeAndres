"305","2017-10-18","Reddit has been turned into Elon Musk's personal advertising medium","There was SO MUCH bad news regarding Tesla and Elon that came out today:

* [Tesla fires employees with no warning;
 workers claim it was done to cut costs and not performance-driven](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/tesla-firings-former-and-current-employees-allege-layoffs.html)
* [Tesla breaks promise that superchargers would be free for Model 3 drivers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4114095-tesla-breaks-another-model-3-promise)
* [Tesla workers allege use of daily racial harassment at factory](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16489650/tesla-lawsuit-racial-harassment-factory-slurs)
* [Model 3 production delayed by welding woes](http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/tesla-might-be-missing-spot-weld)

How much of that is on the front page right now? Instead, a fluffy and extremely irresponsible quote by an astronaut [makes it to](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/7713e8/astronaut_scott_kelly_i_thought_elon_musk_was/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=space) +20,000 in three hours. Yes, because he landed a rocket on a barge you should never, ever doubt anything the man says. Not the Hyperloop. Not that we are living in a simulation. Not that BFR will be done by 2022. Not that Tesla will meet its deadlines. Let's let him do whatever he wants. Let's let him tunnel under the whole Northeast. Let's give him an energy monopoly over Puerto Rico. Let's give him NASA's whole budget.

I'm extremely disappointed by this website at times. This is one of those moments. The only upside is that we are likely to receive a mass of new subscribers today."

Enjoy, the list of several common misconceptions / fake news corrected:

* This mission was never intended to go ""to Mars"", even though it was repeated multiple times, including the stream and Musk himself. Making martian flyby would put SpaceX in a lot of harsh criticism from planetary scientists, due to non-compliance with planetary protection. So it was never even an option. Getting to the Martian orbit was not possible either, upper stage in its current configuration doesn't have enough power to even survive operational the the orbit of the moon, yet alone: make injection into martian orbit, even if there would be fuel for that (which weren't). The whole story with the flight to the mars as incorrect from the very beginning.
* Unlike shown in the promotional video - roadster did not separate from the upper stage. It's unknown whether it was intentional or not.
* Having operational Falcon Heavy did not open any new launch possibilities beyond [GTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_transfer_orbit). Any of the operational heavy launch vehicles and at least some of the current medium LVs with cryogenic uppers stages could lift equal or HEAVIER payload to similar orbit. In fact: Delta IV Heavy could easily lift *three and a half of Tesla Roadsters*. [In fact even Atlas 5 outperforms recoverable Falcon Heavy](https://i.imgur.com/inn7HIl.png) and it's just a medium launch vehicle. Falcon Heavy is severely crippled but its upper stage, and currently there's no work done on ever implementing Raptor in Falcon family (and even then: Raptor is still a liquid methane engine, which puts it in a disadvantage when compared to liquid hydrogen upper stages, such as Centaur or ESC-A of Ariane 5 - the higher C3 launch the more troublesome it would be).
* Recovery has not suddenly became not be-all-end-all of spaceflight. To the orbit from today's launch recoverable Falcon Heavy lifts 1495kg, while expendable launches 5265kg. The price for recovery is enormous in high [C3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_energy) launches.
* LEO performance of 63.8t is rather... questionable. Both: In terms of whether upper stage can actually withstand such a load and whether there would be any payload to even test it that fits under the [small fairing](https://i.imgur.com/FTm01vB.jpg) of the rocket.
*  SpaceX initially announced an inaccurate orbit of 0.96 AU x 2.61 AU - orbit revised by JPL is 0.986 AU x 1.167 AU x 1.05° (C3 of 12 km2/s2). Despite of all the hype - rocket did not exceed initially planned trajectory and it is not going to the asteroid belt (fun fact: just 2.5h before SpaceX released new info Musk still [posted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/961359174230773765) that it's going to the belt). It's aphelion is almost equal to the one of Mars, however it will still not get anywhere near the red planet.
* Upper stage composite will survive centuries in its current orbit. However it won't be ""billions of years"" as said by SpaceX... its remains might though. Over the course of millennia radiation and microscopic particles in the interstellar space will pepper it until nothing of note remains. Car and the upper stage are extremely fragile as far as the large time scales go. Even a gain of sand has a destructive power of a hand grenade with the speeds involved.
* There won't be any crewed mission to the Moon on Falcon Heavy. Planned flight of Dragon V2 was cancelled yesterday, and Musk announced that currently they have no plans of man-rating Falcon Heavy. It's not a Mars rocket either, no more than Proton or Ariane is.
* SpaceX quotes $90m price for 8.5t GTO recoverable launch. It does not cost $90m to launch 26.7t to GTO nor 63.8t to LEO. [SpaceX pricing](http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities) is made in a very obscure way, mixing recoverable and expendable prices with performance.
* It wasn't the first commercial mission beyond Earth orbit. European [4M mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Memorial_Moon_Mission) bears that privilege (unless you count AsiaSat lunar gravity assist, but again: it wasn't the goal of the mission, just a successful recovery attempt)
* Falcon Heavy is not the first rocket able to lift a car, nor the first one able to lift it to Mars. There are multiple existing launch vehicles capable of doing it, Roadster is rather light payload, with a mass of less than 1.4 tonne its nowhere near the big scientific spacecrafts that reach Mars, most notably recent 3.7t European [ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter) launched with Proton rocket which entered an actual Martian orbit and currently nears the competition of breaking maneuvers using the atmosphere of red planet.
* SpaceX did not offer any launch for NASA on the first Falcon Heavy flight, neither paid nor free. (info from the NASA Public Affairs Office) The fact that SpaceX VP said that they did to one journalist seems oddly reactionary to the criticism received, very much looks like a statement made up in place to dodge any negative coverage of their launch. They did not expect that Lori Garver would escalate the single sentence globally.

And a bonus points for SLS comparisons:

* Falcon Heavy is not comparable to SLS and it will not replace it. SLS is beyond-earth-orbit rocket, it covers the area where Falcon Heavy is the weakest. But even to LEO SLS got 6 tonne advantage. If SLS would be about launching payloads to the Moon Falcon Heavy can handle - there would be no need for it, Delta IV Heavy can do basically the same job.
* Falcon Heavy in no way could replace SLS for building Deep Space Gateway. They would need something like ULA's proposed ACES upper stage and distributed launch. While in the end it likely would be cheaper - that's nowhere near the interests of SpaceX
* Money spent on SLS would not go to SpaceX if they'd fly Falcon Heavy earlier, or what not. It's a US senate decision to fund this rocket with targetted funds for it. Cancelling SLS would mean cancelling any money NASA gets to build it.
* No, SpaceX did not just made all the other rockets pointless"

Tesla also spends hundreds of millions on advertising: http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1564590-17-3118&cik=1318605

You ever wonder why there's not many Tesla/Elon Musk ads on TV, Radio or on billboards? It's because the majority of these hundreds of millions go towards Online Advertising. Yes, I'm talking about astroturfing: https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/7fyes3/there_seem_to_be_professional_shills_for_elon/ (Ever find it strange how Elon and his companies are in the top 50 of /r/all literally all the time?)

This is also why Elon Musk and his companies refuse to travel outside of America. Other nations have laws that protect consumers so they know what they're seeing, but America doesn't because it's Corporation before Community.

Whereever you look it is Elon Musk even in totally unrelated subs like r/pics, r/wsb or r/bitcoin or whatever. The Musk post in r/wsb has thousands of upvotes i never saw a post in that sub with so many upvotes.

Whenever i open up the reddit app i either see Musks face, Musks rocket or this starman picture.

Every comment chain is filled with people worshipping Musk. „He is actually contributing to science“, „Elon Musk is to most important man in the world“, „Elon Musk cured cancer“, „Elon Musk made all our lifes better“, „Who cares if Elon Musk pays his workers like shit?“

The moment you say anything negative about Musk you will get downvoted.

Reddit lost its function and is pointless.

All you have is people worshipping a billionaire and his shady business tactics who hope to live on a fucking bare rock someday. I am convinced reddit is filled with retards, nerds, kids, pseudo science lovers and people with absolutely zero social environment or abilities.

Musk is a genius marketing man making billions of a company that never turned a profit, convincing people to put a deposit down for a car they never saw. Selling „flamethrowers“ for $500. This man exactly knows how his audience and fans think and he also knows exactly how to empty their pockets.

Even for the Model 3, people call Elon „optimistic“ in his timeframes when in fact it is one of the most shady business tactics. Making overly positive promises like FSD in just 2 years, 5000/week Model 3s by 2017 and so on to get people commit themselves to buy this car and reserve it. Once that happens all these goals get pushed for years, Alcantara headliners get removed and the 35k version isnt even available but people will just buy the more expensive version even if they never planned that.

This phenomen is called the „Escalation of commitment“ and as i said, one of the most shady business tactics to use. The definition of wiki perfectly describes everyone of the 500k Model 3 reservation holders:

>Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment

All of Musks strategies are build on top of this fundamental principle. Rather than accepting this people will call him optimistic. Other CEOs would have been laughed out of the room as morons who obviously have no clue about their companies real engineering capabilities if they regularly set such unrealistic timeframes - but Musk? Nah hes just optimistic and wants to motivate his workers. Maybe try to motivate with an industry standard payment?

### U.S. Government Industrial Policy

The US government is infamous for its lack of long-term strategic vision due to democratically elected representatives who loathe spending money on anything that can't be explained to the voters and presidents who hate projects that take more than term limits to complete. Because of this the US suffered many embarrassments in its history: neglecting its navy after the War of 1812, neglecting its army after WWI, neglecting rocketry after WWII, etc.

The US is also endowed with a great and very productive economy which enable it to channel vast sums of money and resources at any problem and solve it in record time and even overtake its counterparts. The method the US government has chosen to execute this since WWI is to give huge contracts to capable companies, these contracts would finance the R&D of the technology, the capital expenditure on plant and equipment and the production cost of the product itself plus profits for the company of course.

The owners of the company that is awarded the contract get _to keep_ the plant, the designs, the patents and sell the product to third parties and since the US government kindly financed the R&D and capital expenditure on plants and equipment their product is highly competitive and is exported to many countries or sold to the public if there is a civilian use for it. That's how the US fostered and supported its corporations since WWI.

I will give one example from WWI: [The Linclon Motor Company](http://bit.ly/2KD6jcZ), Henry Leland was one of the founders of the Cadillac Automobile Company, left that company to manufacture engines for the government during WWI. He got a $10,000,000 contract (in 1917 money!) to build the Liberty V12 aircraft engine a design that was owned by the US government (up to the end of WWII the US would take ownership of the design if they financed it); the contract was only to manufacture it (they gave manufacturing contracts to several companies, not only him), he _then_ built the [Lincoln Motor Company Plant](http://bit.ly/2KECmJC) to assemble it from parts sourced from other companies, producing 6,500 engines. Afterwards he retooled and produced the [Lincoln L-Series](http://bit.ly/2zft41y). The US government basically gifted him a factory.

This method greatly expanded in WWII and afterwards with the US government paying basically for everything from the basic science research (via public universities, National Science Foundation, etc), the early R&D, testing and finally the actual cost of production and the company gets to keep all the technology and tools and sell the product to third-parties and keep all the profits. All this is documented in public records, this _gifting_ of millions of dollars from the public purse is not a secret. This is true for every jet fighter, bomber, tank, gun, computer, satellite—and as we shall see below—space rocket the US government buys.

_In Summary: The US government fully finances the development of new technologies, the plants to build them, then buys the products and gifts the rest to the corporation. It might resemble feudalism more than capitalism with the king/government giving out land/money to their retainers for services rendered, but it is the reality of the US today._

### The U.S. Lags Behind, Again!

When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik the shock of discovering that the US now lags behind was so big the moment has become a proverb: A Sputnik Moment. The US poured money into rocketry in an effort to catch up but the Soviet Union kept getting all the records: first orbit, first animal, first man, first woman, first spacewalk. Of course the US response was to pour so much money into such an “impossible” goal that it would overshadow the Soviet Union: it built the mighty Saturn V and put a man on the Moon, the space race was settled.

Although the space race was settled life went on after the Apollo program achieved its goal and the US chose to build a _revolutionary_ Space Shuttle using liquid hydrogen engines that take off once a week and can be re-used many times, the shuttle would have sustained an eventual orbital station but the reality was it consumed so much resources that no development was done on the eventual station to be serviced. 

The Soviet Union chose to build simple space stations using the existing technology, the cosmonauts would take off in orbiters not so different from Vostok 1 (Yuri Gagarin's orbiter) in its conception on a variant of the [R-7](http://bit.ly/2zjxO67) rocket that was used in that first mission. All of the Soviet (first stage) engines used kerosene similar to the mighty Saturn V's first stage, using the more powerful liquid hydrogen was too expensive and technically demanding for a Soviet Union less than 15 years from desolation.

The Space Shuttle turned into a strategic failure: re-usability was minimal as the shuttle needed solid-fuel boosters to get into orbit and major refurbishment to reuse the engines. It would launch twice or three times in a year instead of once per week and although the number of US astronauts increased dramatically in the 80's the reality was most of them were staying about a week in orbit. The Soviet Union incrementally developing their technology and sticking with the kerosene engines had a series of [space stations](http://bit.ly/2u2xraZ) in orbit then in 1986 started building the world's first modular space station (another first!)--and the direct predecessor of the International Space Station (ISS)--the: [Mir Space Station](http://bit.ly/2KUNsta)

The US got lucky and instead of catching up it benefited from the desolation of the Soviet Union and became a partner in the Mir program, re-learning what was lost since Skylab (the US space station launched by the mighty Saturn V), it was able to dock the shuttle to Mir, US astronauts spent time in a space station and work started on ISS, which was built on the Russian core module [Zvezda](http://bit.ly/2KBC1au) an incremental development from Mir and without it ISS would not have been possible.

This luck would actually make the US complacent and they would concentrate on the more glamours aspects of space while depending on the Russians for the mundane, their famous lack of strategic vision would strike again: the lifetime of the Space Shuttle nearing its end without a viable rocket to supply the US part of ISS or even put astronauts to orbit.

At the same time commercial satellites were becoming a boom business but the two main companies with rockets to launch them, Boeing & Lockheed Martin, combined in 2006, into a single company called ULA: [United Launch Alliance](http://bit.ly/2udDGbg). Lucrative government (Pentagon & NASA) contracts and no other competitor would make ULA an exclusive government contractor uninterested in competing against low-cost commercial launchers, namely: Europe, Russia, China and India. ULA even sources the first stage kerosene engine for the [Atlas V](http://bit.ly/2J2KJJi) rocket from Russia, as long as the US government is paying why not source a reliable Russian engine and bill the government for it.

The realization that the US lacked rockets to service the manned space program and compete in the commercial market was another Sputnik moment, it spurred the government into another spending spree to catch up, a spending spree that would benefit anyone who had the vision to develop a low-cost kerosene engine, in the next section we'll meet such visionary.

_In Summary: By 2005 the US was facing the reality of the Space Shuttle retirement without a replacement launcher to send astronauts to ISS or a supply spacecraft to supply them there. At the same time it became apparent that commercial rocket launching is booming and the US did not have a single viable provider._

### A Brilliant Engineer and the Merlin

**[Tom Mueller](http://bit.ly/2u132dj)**: is the son of a logger who himself worked at logging to pay for his education, eventually obtaining a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering he worked for TWR, an automotive and aerospace conglomerate, and was the lead on the liquid hydrogen [TR-106](http://bit.ly/2NztvXu) rocket engine. one of the most powerful engines ever built. This engine used a [pintle injector](http://bit.ly/2KCnsUd): a device that was developed (by a TWR division) for the Apollo program which was of course funded by NASA, we shall see the same device later.

This man's ingenuity and achievement is what gave the US a chance to get into the commercial rocket launches that had been dominated by Europe, Russia and newcomers: China and India. Since he is the specialist in rocket engines, here is a good place to discuss them.

Liquid fuel engines are conceptually very easy and they have changed very little since the first operational rocket: the German V-2. Such a rocket has two tanks containing an oxidizer, usually liquid oxygen, and fuel; the two are mixed under pressure in a burning chamber then the resulting gas exit through a nozzle that force it into supersonic speeds.

Oxygen liquefies at −182.96 degree C and in case of an emergency it can simply be vented into the atmosphere which is already 20% oxygen by composition. The problem of liquid fuel engines is in the fuel part.

The Germans used ethanol (alcohol) for the V-2 which is liquid at normal conditions. The Soviet Union used kerosene for its space program rockets (the vital first stage and not necessary all stages). The US also used kerosene in the mighty Saturn V first stage. The type used in rockets, called [RP-1](http://bit.ly/2u7fzLo), is a highly refined type of kerosene which is liquid at normal conditions.

Kerosene has more energy than ethanol per unit of weight: 46 vs 29 MJ/kg, but it is dwarfed by hydrogen at 141 MJ/kg ([source](http://bit.ly/2m1Iltp)). Thus using hydrogen “releases more energy per unit mass during combustion, enabling a higher exhaust velocity ” as Wikipedia explains.

The problem of hydrogen is that unlike kerosene it is a gas that needs to be liquefied and at normal conditions it is about 70 degrees colder than liquid oxygen: −252.87 vs −182.96 degree C and if anything goes wrong or the launch is scrapped the liquid hydrogen can not be vented into the atmosphere and has to be pumped out of the rocket and processed. This is the fuel chosen by NASA for the Space Shuttle, which was supposed to launch on a weekly basis: a volatile cryogenic highly explosive expensive gas abandoning the cheap reliable liquid fuel that was the standard.

The liquid hydrogen engine is a sport car, an Arabian horse, the gold-plated high-tech rocket engine that only the government can afford and the US discovered too late that commercial payloads are better handled by cheaper rockets; what was needed was a kerosene engine, that is the SUV, the workhorse, the reliable over-engineered (no pun intended) engine that took man to space first and then to the Moon. 

By 2001 the US had no kerosene engine in development, that's when a brilliant engineer, Tom Mueller, would start developing one in a garage, he of course did not invent anything new he basically made an engine similar to the [Saturn V first stage engine](http://bit.ly/2KUoF8L). I have no knowledge about that engine's design but one would think it was similar to what he has done before, I also have no knowledge how much of that engine would go into the Merlin but since the Falcon 1 would launch only 4 years after SpaceX founding with a Merlin and a vacuum-optimized stripped-down version called the Kestrel, I think it's safe to assume the garage engine was developed into the Merlin, maybe they only differ in material and production based design.

What we do know is that the Merlin uses a pintle injector, that Apollo program technology used in TWR's TR-106 under Mueller's lead; I think it is safe to assume, although we can't know for sure, that his garage engine also had a pintle. This and many other developments funded by the vast sums invested by the government is what made it possible for a private company in 2002 to build a rocket engine. It's very easy to climb a mountain specially if you ride to the top on a government-funded helicopter.

As to the beating heart of an engine that would be the turbopump: anyone can connect a tank of oxygen with a tank of kerosene and funnel the fire out of a nozzle, but that won't get you a rocket engine, at best you'll end up with a _novelty flamethrower_; what makes the engine is the turbopump that pumps the two elements and force them to combine and exit under high pressure generating thrust. The turbopump in the first Merlin engines was [designed and produced by Barber-Nichols](http://bit.ly/2zkKidU), if there is anything remarkable about it then it was kept out of the Media, as far as I can see it's just a bespoke turbopump.

A classic design, technology developed by NASA, critical components sourced from established suppliers that is, in summary, the Merlin engine, nothing revolutionary nothing extraordinary. Indeed two different US rocket companies buy similar engines from Russia, but then headlines like: “[Inside SpaceX’s Revolutionary Merlin Engines That Could Take Us to Mars](http://bit.ly/2KHvqve)” get published without explaining what is so “revolutionary” about it, indeed the word “revolution” is not mentioned _once_ in the body of that article. This kind of hyperbolic claims has been the norm for SpaceX coverage which greatly skews the context (plus the Merlin is not even the engine SpaceX intends to use for Mars).

As to Mueller I am not really surprised that not many people have heard of this man, not only is the Media not interested in him (the above cited article doesn't mention him for example) but even on Wikipedia his role is not given its due: he is mentioned once on [History of SpaceX](http://bit.ly/2lZ6VuH) in a context that make it seem he was recruited to work in his specialty: “In early 2002 Musk was seeking staff for the new company and approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller,” when in reality Musk [went to see his garage engine](http://bit.ly/2J6Ko8m) and Mueller basically co-founded SpaceX with his engine to Musk's money. He is mentioned once on the [Merlin engine family](http://bit.ly/2KTBDQL) in a context of a statement he made in 2015 and nothing about his early work or the fact that he is the chief designer of the whole family!

Mueller seems to be very happy having achieved success and either he does not seek the limelight or can live with the fact that only people in the business know his name. One would expect that Mueller who holds a Masters degree, who have experience in designing and building rocket engines, who built the most valuable thing SpaceX has, namely the Merlin engine would be SpaceX Chief Technology Officer but it seems Musk [who has a Bachelor in Physics](http://bit.ly/2zkVYgw) and a degree in Economic from a business school and became a businessman is more suited to being SpaceX CTO while Mueller is given the very specific title of “Chief Technology Officer of Propulsion.”

_In Summary: Mueller is a brilliant engineer who started the development of a kerosene engine in a garage which later became the Merlin engine, he co-founded SpaceX and is doing a great job developing engines for its rockets._

### A Brilliant Executive

**[Gwynne Shotwell](http://bit.ly/2KWe7Tf)** : the daughter of a surgeon she obtained, with honors, a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics; she worked at The Aerospace Corporation: a nonprofit corporation that operates a federally funded research and development center providing technical guidance and advice on all aspects of space missions to military, civil, and commercial customers.

In 1998 Shotwell left to become director of the space systems division at Microcosm Inc. a company that does “space mission engineering [for] commercial, military, and scientific missions from small, low-cost programs to multi-billion dollar, multi-satellite constellations and a family of launch vehicles.”

After four years at Microcosm Shotwell joined SpaceX in the year of its founding, she was its eleventh employee, as vice president of business development with a seat on the SpaceX board of directors. Today she is the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of SpaceX, I can't date exactly when she got that position but her role in making SpaceX what it is today is undisputed as [one article](http://bit.ly/2KFy98F) puts it: “[she] played a crucial role in the $2 billion contract with NASA, ensuring a healthy turnaround when the company was down and out in 2008.” - we will discuss in detail the 2008 events in the next section.

As with Mueller she lives in the shadow of Musk who hugs all the limelight, on the SpaceX [Wikipedia page](http://bit.ly/2u7hUWG) she is mentioned only once: in the company infobox and otherwise only in the titles of articles in the sources section as one would expect; for who is better to inform the public than the President and COO who is actually in the offices every day instead the Wikipedia article (reflecting the general Media) make it seem as if SpaceX is run by its celebrity CEO who is also the CEO of an automotive company, a tunnel digging company, who opened a private school for his children, who constantly giving presentations and a daily twitter user.

Shotwell's profile is much higher than Mueller, partly because her position is higher and because the Media love the story of a woman leading a tech company. She seem just as happy as Mueller and accepting whatever working with Musk entails—from Mars missions to overshadowing her—because for her personally heading a company like SpaceX was probably not even something she dreamed of doing when working at Microcosm.

_In Summary: The President & COO of SpaceX is a brilliant executive with exactly the right educational background, the right experience with government and space companies to lead SpaceX and she has done an incredible job and achieved great success._

### The Falcon 1

In the late 1950's NACA (the predecessor of NASA) designed the [SCOUT](http://bit.ly/2ucgvOA) rocket using existing military rockets combined to form a multi-stage solid fuel rocket capable of launching small satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The SCOUT rocket family were very successful: used from 1961 to 1994.

In 2002 SpaceX started the development of the [Falcon 1](http://bit.ly/2J0uqNe) a two-stage liquid fuel rocket with a single Merlin in the first stage and a single Kestrel in the second. The payload was similar to the SCOUT rocket _successfully_ developed 45 years before and yet despite all the accumulated knowledge, improvement in tools and materials, the use of existing parts for the engines and the rocket, the Falcon 1 failed 3 out of its five launches.

The firs three were all failures; the first successful launch was in September 2008 carrying a test load but by the end of 2008 SpaceX had run out of funds and was still to launch a useful payload and with only one contract (a 180 kg satellite in LEO) the company was going into Christmas facing bankruptcy. 

SpaceX ambition for the Falcon 1 was to be a testbed for the technology and _also_ provide financing to continue developing a larger rocket and a supply spacecraft for ISS. The Falcon 1 was built with private funds without government contract or a guarantee but as we shall see below all private-funded development amounted to no more than showing NASA that they are credible and can be awarded a contract similar to other established contractors (this is not unique to SpaceX most contractors spend their capital proving to the government they can do the job and not actually developing anything commercially useful).

Developing a small rocket that can put a small payloads into LEO in the hope of turning that into a profitable operation that funds the rest of the company turned out to be a failure. We shall see in the next section how SpaceX became a success.

_In Summary: Building on technology developed by the US government in the 1960's and with the use of modern materials, computers and design processes SpaceX managed to almost bankrupt itself developing a rocket on par with a 45 year old vehicle._

### The Falcon 9 and the Dragon

In this section we can read our story in [NASA Inspector General report (PDF)](https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-18-016.pdf) about the supply contracts for ISS (I told you everything is in public records), I will be quoting from it below, labeled: IG report.

The [Dragon](http://bit.ly/2J2MypC) supply spacecraft and its rocket the Falcon 9 were started in 2006 funded by NASA: “Between 2006 and 2008, NASA entered into a series of funded agreements with Orbital ATK and SpaceX to _stimulate_ U.S. commercial development of transportation systems capable of providing cargo delivery services to the ISS.... Orbital ATK and SpaceX _ultimately_ contributed more than 50 percent of the development costs of their respective spaceflight systems while receiving more than $700 million from NASA...” - (IG report, emphasis added).

At the end of 2008 the company was heading towards bankruptcy, As ArsTechnica [puts it](http://bit.ly/2MVnUcN) : “the company appeared poised to go bankrupt as it struggled to meet payroll in late 2008. Even as its cash ran out, SpaceX was in the midst of capital-intensive transition from the single-engine Falcon 1 rocket to the much more complex Falcon 9 rocket.”

The Market has spoken: SpaceX is a loser. Fortunately for SpaceX the US government was in the business of choosing winners and losers and realizing that the US had _no_ way to supply ISS and they would have to depend on the Russians for both the launching of astronauts _and_ supply they decided to open their purse and “In 2008, while development efforts were _still underway_, NASA awarded fixed-price contracts with task orders initially valued at $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion to Orbital ATK and SpaceX, respectively, for 20 cargo resupply missions to the ISS through 2016” - (IG report, emphasis added)

Orbital ATK would develop the [Cygnus](http://bit.ly/2uc86uE) supply craft and launch it on the Antares rocket using a Russian-made kerosene engine (first launch 2013) while SpaceX would finish developing the Dragon supply craft and launch it on the Falcon 9 using US-made kerosene engine (first launch 2010). The Falcon 1 was quickly retired after fulfilling that single contract, even though SpaceX was four years from the Falcon 9 first launch; clearly there was no profit to be made from it and it was nothing but a technology demonstrator.

This contract saved SpaceX or as ArsTechnica puts it: “Without NASA there would be no SpaceX” nor would there be Cygnus spacecraft or ISS or Saturn V or a moon landing and without the US deep pockets there wouldn't be an Internet or a national highway connecting the US or a transcontinental railway or even the Panama canal. Still people think that SpaceX has developed space rockets and spacecrafts for a few hundred million dollars of private funding!

The contract would be extended to “a total of 31 missions...worth $5.9 billion, or an *average cost of $191.3 million per mission*” (IG report, emphasis added). SpaceX has launched the 15th supply mission in June 2018, While Orbital ATK launched the ninth in May 2018; leaving 7 more supply missions under the extended 2008 contract.

The cost per launch for the Falcon 9 is [advertised](http://bit.ly/2KSpzlZ) as $62 million and yet NASA pays $191 million, does the Dragon costs $130 million or does the Cygnus mission cost several hundred millions skewing the average, or maybe SpaceX is selling cheap commercial launches because the average cost in the report includes the development money while the $61 million is the cost of manufacturing and launching only?

We have no way of knowing the true total economic cost of a Falcon 9 launch, but if I am right then NASA has helped SpaceX reduce the cost of commercial launches, this is actually the justification of the US industrial policy of generous give outs: it brings the prices down for corporations and individuals. Unfortunately SpaceX, and the Media, has fostered the illusion that all of this was done with “private” funding and it proves that private companies can have a space program surpassing that of NASA, the main benefactor of SpaceX!

SpaceX [claimed in 2014](http://bit.ly/2KGJB3N) that NASA provided $396 million towards the development of the Dragon and the Falcon 9 (shouldn't NASA own part of the IP then?) and SpaceX provided $450 million, but the total funding rounds of SpaceX up to 2014 was $258.4 million ([source](http://bit.ly/2u9I8I8)) which mostly funded the development of the Merlin and the Falcon 1. The big funding round was in 2015 when lead investor Google bet big on the company _after_ the success of the Falcon 9/Dragon resupply missions.

So how could SpaceX a company that was only funded to the tune of $260 million contribute $450 million to the development of the Dragon/Falcon 9? Well my theory (and it is impossible to know exactly) is that as the contract given to them by NASA was _guaranteed_ ([press release on SpaceX website](http://bit.ly/2m1Gdl8)) all they had to do is walk to the nearest bank and show that they can fulfill the contract and the bank would discount the contract's value the same way bills are discounted, the more probable SpaceX can fulfill it the more cash they get. Guaranteed government contracts are like bonds and it's easier for NASA to guarantee contracts and let the banks finance the project than paying cash from the annual budget, so in my opinion the funding provided by SpaceX was predicated on getting the _guaranteed_ contracts in the first place.

In 2016 when both companies had operational vehicles NASA issued a new contract for supplying ISS, but now the companies were _only_ guaranteed 6 missions each (IG report). Having stood both suppliers up by funding and guaranteed contracts NASA now has a more familiar customer/supplier relations with them (a third company, [Sierra Nevada](http://bit.ly/2tXCJVl), was also awarded a contract but is yet to launch).

This is how the US functions, they chose winners and losers they have been doing it for a long time now. SpaceX is not the first and will not be the last, it's not the biggest nor the smallest, it's not doing the worst job nor is it doing something revolutionary, as another [headline](http://bit.ly/2J2MUws) claims the Dragon is revolutionary. The only new thing the Dragon has done is to be re-used (after refurbishment) but actually the Space Shuttle was a (very big and expensive) supply craft that was used multiple times.

SpaceX is just one of two US companies supplying ISS sharing the honor with the Russian Progress supply craft, both the European and Japanese have domestically designed and built supply spacecrafts, the European one is retired and the Japanese is launching in August 2018. China has its own supply spacecraft based on the design of Progress (which they bought from the Russians) and has been launched and fully tested. Of all the supply spacecrafts the Russian Progress has the most launches (157 missions to ISS to the Dragon's 15), being in use since 1978 when it supplied Salyut 6 and being continually developed and improved, it has supplied both Mir space station and ISS and is still in use. 

_In Summary: The $1.6 billion NASA contract at the end of 2008 to resupply ISS saved SpaceX from possible bankruptcy and financed both the development of The Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. SpaceX resupply of ISS is a routine operation it shares with Orbital ATK and the Russian space agency. The Falcon 9 is a typical working-horse launch rocket with no exceptional features._

### Landing Used First Stage

Landing a rocket is not an impressive achievement when compared with what had been achieved in space and in general. It's a party trick meant to impress people who have never heard of [Control Theory](http://bit.ly/2MUvR1W) and who don't really know how hard it was to land a man on the Moon with early 1960's technology, or land the Curiosity rover on Mars or pick up Voyager's signal from the edge of the solar system decades after its launch, now that's an achievement!

The Space Shuttle landing is magnitudes more impressive and the error margin is magnitudes less than landing a spent rocket on a drone ship and yet every single landing of the Shuttle was a success, something that can't be said for the Falcon 9 rockets.

If it is not hard then why hasn't other launch providers done it before? Well the answer is very simple because they would bundle multiple payloads together and use _all_ the fuel to put all of them into orbit, without _extra fuel_ they can't land the rockets and they ditch them into the ocean. In reality this party trick has been done years before and Blue Origin did it after SpaceX and foreign competitors have said they will do the same because vertically landing rockets is not actually “rocket science” and SpaceX has no patent on it to prevent everyone else from doing it.

When the payload is too big or there are multiple of them leaving no _extra fuel_, for landing the rockets, SpaceX is more than happy to ditch them into the ocean. We have no way of knowing if recovering the boosters and re-using them is more _commercially_ profitable than bundling payloads to make maximum use of the rocket, as _all other commercial_ launch providers seem to do.

I know of no instance when SpaceX deliberately divided the payloads to recover the rocket. The Dragon launches at about 4,200 kg and so there remains extra fuel to land and “save” money, but NASA is actually paying an average of $191 million per launch (see IG report last section) so I am not sure if the eventual saving after costing landing, recovery and refurbishment is worthwhile, but of course we can't know for sure.

_In Summary: Landing rockets is a party trick to impress simple people. There is no evidence that recovering and reusing rockets is commercially profitable on the long run. Recovering rockets is only possible if the rocket launch capability was not utilized to the maximum._

### The Future

**Government Contracts**: US participation in ISS is guaranteed to 2024, so resupply contracts to SpaceX (and Orbital ATK) should continue until then. SpaceX has become a regular in launching NASA satellites and probes and this should continue, they also broke ULA's 10 year monopoly of military launch contracts when they launched, in 2016, a GPS satellite.

Days after NASA announced a shift from a human journey to Mars to concentrate on the Moon SpaceX would similarly announce the scaling down of the Mars lander development and concentration on a possible Moon missions (as ArsTechnica puts it: _[Musk revises his Mars ambitions, and they seem a little bit more real](http://bit.ly/2NymDtf)_). In my opinion and it is impossible to know for sure: SpaceX was repeating its Dragon gambit, it was positioning itself to receive the eventual NASA contracts and it had no serious intention of _self-financing_ a Mars mission (a burden that eventually proved too high even for NASA's budget to bear). Once NASA changed its goal, so did SpaceX follow suit.

**New Rockets**: The Falcon Heavy a Falcon 9 rocket with two first stages strapped to the side is the next iteration in the Falcon family. SpaceX successfully launched it in February 2018 with a dummy payload and it's scheduled to launch again in October as a certification process for the US Air Force but also with secondary payloads. The dummy payload was about 1,300 kg while the second launch will have a 5,000 kg ballast mass to certify the rocket's capability ([source](http://bit.ly/2ueyyDX)), so real success is the second launch and not the silly spectacle of a car in orbit.

The second rocket, the [BFR](http://bit.ly/2ziCCss), in development at SpaceX is a bigger more powerful rocket than the mighty Saturn V (!) using a new engine named Raptor fueled by liquid methane (natural gas). While Saturn V first stage had 5 rockets the BFR has 31 Raptor engines in its first stage! The Media reports that is fully funded by SpaceX, but at least the Raptor is being co-funded by the military.

**Competitors**: competition is the biggest headwind facing SpaceX. In the sector of government launch contracts SpaceX is the competition to the established ULA who are currently developing a new rocket and starting to improve their public image realizing at last that the general public is the real customer and not the bureaucrats in the Pentagon or NASA.

In the sector of ISS resupply SpaceX was always one of two companies, unfortunately Orbital ATK never played the PR game and so while a lot of people know about and follow the Dragon missions few seem to realize that Cygnus does the same supply missions (and other countries has been doing this mission for a long time), the company was recently acquired by Northrop Grumman so a change might be coming, either leave the sector or expand. A second competitor is on the horizon with a spacecraft named: [Dream Chaser](http://bit.ly/2tZO3Ac), with the look of a miniature Space Shuttle; that should get people to post tweets about it!

In the sector of commercial launches the competition is red hot from inside and outside the US, both by government funded launchers and new commercial companies. SpaceX breached the walls of orbit launching and proved that a private company (with generous funding from the government) can supply commercial launches (whether it can do it profitably is still an open question) but just like Tesla this heroic gamble opened the doors to many others who gladly followed in its path. Europe, Russia, China and India who seemed at the end of the 2010's to dominate the commercial launch sector to the exclusion of the US has seen their market share decline and they have stepped up their efforts and are determined to capture their share from the market by hook or crook.

[Blue Origin](http://bit.ly/2zifESh) is shaping up to be a major player in exactly the same sector that SpaceX now seem to rule. The company is financed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos to the tune of $1 billion per year and planing on being both an engine supplier and a rocket company; it will put tremendous pressure on SpaceX directly and help other companies transition from their dependency on Russian engines (which has to be regularly exempted from ongoing sanctions and thus represent a high risk). They are developing a new liquid methane (which has more power than kerosene but is less cumbersome than liquid hydrogen) engine: the BE-4, co-developed by ULA for their new rocket.

[Aerojet Rocketdyne](http://bit.ly/2KTD8hR) a major US rocket engine supplier, which is supplying NASA with new RS-25 engines for their SLS rocket, is currently developing AR-1 a new kerosene engine. This will also help SpaceX competitors wean themselves off the Russians engines. The Merlin is not going to be the only US made kerosene engine for long.

**Profitability** : SpaceX is a private company so we have no idea if they are making or losing money on every launch, whether they are making money on the government contract and subsidizing the commercial launches or _visa versa_. We have no idea if they are making enough to invest in new engines and rockets or if they have to raise funds and/or borrow money. As to the [claims](http://bit.ly/2KW6rk0) of profitability by the COO, that's just PR and US courts have clearly ruled PR to be protected under the 1st amendment and so they can claim anything they want as long as they are not selling anything (including shares in the company) based on those claims. With all due respect to Shotwell I believe she is talking about each individual launch being profitable thanks to NASA paying for the development costs, which is a government contractor kind of profitable and not as the Media sells it, i.e. as a “private” company kind of profitable, but I could be wrong and they might be highly profitable.

**Funding**: According to [Forbes](http://bit.ly/2MSGoe7) in early April 2018 “SpaceX authorized a $507 million round of Series I funding...priced at $169 per share, this round would bring SpaceX's total valuation to $25 billion.” They were not able to raise that according to what has been [reported](https://yhoo.it/2KTA9co) (also see CrunchBase link above): “SpaceX says it’s brought in $214 million so far, less than two weeks after the round opened. That leaves $286 million yet to be sold.”

The question that has to be asked is why a 16 year old company that has a regular ISS supply contract with NASA, a major share of the world's commercial launches needs to raise so much money? Clearly their profits (if they are making any) is not enough to fund the new rockets/engines or they need to expand more than what they can organically fund. For now the valuation is great and there is lots of money to fund SpaceX, but as we have seen in 2008 market conditions might change rapidly and funding dry up overnight.

_In Summary: SpaceX is enjoying a leading position in the commercial launch sector, it has ISS resupply contracts to at least 2024, but because of its private nature we have no idea about its financial position. Competition in all sectors is heating up and major players are starting to challenge SpaceX lead._

### Conclusion

The United State is the world's greatest economic power and with a few billion dollars it propelled SpaceX from a company on the verge of bankruptcy to the world's leading commercial rocket launch provider, impressive achievement but nothing compared to how it expanded its armament industry in WWI or WWII or how it regained the lead in the space race and achieved its greatest achievement: landing a man on the Moon. in comparison SpaceX is a run-of-the-mill commercial rocket launch provider that might be or might be not profitable.

SpaceX is an important part of keeping ISS supplied, of providing launch capability for NASA and the Pentagon and for competing in the commercial rocket launch sector and for the foreseeable future if anything should happen to disrupt its operations the US government has the authority, the deep pockets and is more than willing to intervene and firewall SpaceX to protect it from any turmoil.

The reason people were calling bullshit on the China megagigaultrasuperdooperfactory was, at least in part, because no 8-K was filed.

The same applies to the whole ""we're going private"" announcement. Tesla has until Friday to file an 8-K with the SEC. Crucially, they have to stipulate from where the funding will come. Elon made a **factual** statement, that the funding is already secured. This was not a statement of intent; don't let any of the apologists try to pull that bullshit.

So if no 8-K is filed, what we witnessed was likely one of the most blatant and egregious examples of stock manipulation, and was absolutely illegal. The SEC are worse than useless and couldn't organise an orgy in a brothel, but even they couldn't ignore this. In fact, it's so bad that I wouldn't be surprised if it's passed on to the DOJ.

Anyway, that's what you're looking out for. The 8-K. Three days. If Elon wasn't bullshitting just to try and kill off the shorts once and for all, then the 8-K will illuminate the situation."

"341","2018-08-24","Former Tesla Programmer's anecdotes about problems","**** I've added some more ****

I have no way of proving any of this to be true, but I thought it was worth sharing. Enjoy.
-

i used to work for tesla writing infotainment firmware and backend services - all of which runs in a single bottom tier Datacenter in a single location on the worst VMware deployment known to man.

fun fact: a jenkins pipeline once caused almost the entire fleet to reboot loop for about an hour

-

model s and x use openvpn to talk to their backend. inside that backend there are metadata services that feed info to the system, one of those things being a ~20MB+ (generated by the worst erp system) json payload that describes supercharger shit for the map in the touchscreen. somebody was smart enough to do automated linting but forgot to validate against the custom parser the car runs which caused a segfault in the qt app that runs the ui, which in turn for a variety of reasons forces a reboot of that component. I think we clocked about 15 seconds before it read the file and faulted after boot. it was doing that for an hour before everyone panicked and got me and qa on the phone to fix it. i wrote a quick python/fabric script that ssh’d to as many cars as possible at a time to rm the file

-

>why do the cars run a cluster of ubuntu vms?
used to be centos 6 and Ruby on Rails. I haven’t worked there in 3 years, but last I heard it hadn’t changed much for s and x. model 3 uses newer tech, but still based out of a single Datacenter 

-

some of what I wrote runs on the factory line - at the time we started the model s program, which has not changed to this day, we fake the backend to install and validate firmware as the car moves down the line. a tech runs over to the car, plugs an eth cable in diag and dumps an image on the car using curl and a tui app I wrote using python. as the car moves down the line it is installing firmware for about an hour. if that station for any reason can’t talk to the PKI system, erp, or a ruby webapp it halts the line

-

>     can't you flash the storage before its installed in a car?
yes and no. the firmware update process in a car is complicated because you have a bunch of dumb components hanging off of CAN or LIN and they have to updated in very specific order and sometimes you have to retry 10s of times to get it to take. ( fuck you Bosch). Tesla never bothered to flash those things ahead of time before assembly so that gets done the first time as it rolls down the line. the infotainment system and gateway arbitrate that stuff. typically any update that tuned voltages becomes a one way - no downgrade is possible without frying something

-

>this is the thing, like i work with boards that have many devices on them that have firmware and they're all flashed well before the >board is installed in anything if not before even being soldered down
they got smart eventually - model 3 does do this now, but doing that at scale with all the components for a car is a challenge when you have it being done with stations running yocto images and perl

-

>     like, for all the lols @ tesla, have they literally never heard of a process engineer?
like everyone else who was smart they either quit or were fired through no fault of their own so what you’re left with are people fearing for their job who desperately don’t want to change status quo for fear it will break something

-

>they forgot that the unspoken part of ""move fast and break things"" is that you're supposed to fix what's broken

exactly this. we never really had time to address critical issues and were constantly short on staff because people were quitting or they just wouldn't give candidates competitive offers. this is why you hear about people burning out - they've managed to chase everyone away 

-

more fun facts:

the infotainment system and gateway don't have a battery-backed rtc. when the system reboots (sleep, deep sleep, reboot, whatever) the car is at tyool 1970 until it gets ntp again. the logs themselves are written in a binary ring buffer format and when they come in they used to end up in a giant 700TB single mysql database after they were expanded. all of production after-sales service and engineering relies on that single log interpretation system which ran on centos 5 and python 2.4 until hbase/hadoop and friends were brought in.

the supercharger system uses ssh dss keys to ""vpn"" back to the datacenter to a single server over 2G wireless with very limited resources. the connection is essentially simplex for various reasons so getting data to and from the supercharger is usually a 1KB/s operation unless that site has had connection aggregation done. at one point i looked at the system and to pull data out for analysis, somebody had written a bash script that was printf'ing in a for loop across ~5k devices. it would usually take about 3 days to do a successful firmware update on any single supercharger.

we once patched openssl to ignore client cert expiry because somebody forgot to create a process to update keys in the field and all the customer cars started falling offline because their certs had expired. the quick and dirty was to just patch openssl quickly and make openvpn on the server side use that one while we created those processes for about 2 weeks.

-

most of the time me and the other firmware folks were chasing elon's whims about what to do with firmware. where i should have been fixing critical issues in the system i was pulled off to do shit like add farting unicorns 

-

>uh we literally do the same thing; well, yocto images and python

>tesla isn't the first to solder down SOMs running embedded linux and a bunch of MCUs hanging off an i2c/canbus/whatever line


they aren't the first - for what we were doing at the time it made sense and helped us get the program off the ground quickly. lots of room for improvement and in 8 years, they should have done so.

my issue was the fact that the systems doing the flashing were running the yocto images and perl and the guy writing the perl was also responsible for writing the thing that actually updates the car. that thing (the car-side updater) is about ~100k lines of C in a single file. code reviews were always a laugh riot

-

>i am SO GLAD your nda expired


99% of what i'm talking about is ""public"" anyway. tesla isn't encrypting their firmware and it's really easy to glean information from the vpn with a packet cap because nothing inside the vpn (was) encrypted. dumping tegra 3 model s and x is trivial and tesla's cars are nowhere near as secure as they'd have you believe.

for example, at one time you were able to root a model s with a usb stick and a gstreamer exploit. 

-

while tesla should be given credit for updating the car over the air to fix issues, that's also any connected car's biggest weakness - you're one exploit away (or malicious employee with access) from remote root.

more fun stuff: there's limited space on the emmc in the touchscreen system so updating maps can't be done using an image or a binary diff. so the thing rsync's map updates (all 2GB of them) from various places. they may have fixed that in the newer intel-based boards, but who knows.

autopilot had _really_ high turnover at one point before release because some guy from space x came in and gave the entire dept a C pointer/memory test because Elon said they were ""late"" to ship. 

-

>There's the story online of that hacker who was pulling software images off through the door Ethernet port and found that his car's >firmware was remotely downgraded after he uncovered and posted the first references to the P100 models.

>Does that sound plausible to you?


yup, i'm the guy that installed the older versions. this was a marketing mistake really. if i recall correctly, he ended up getting a marketing car or his car got tagged in the update system as a trusted car and he ended up getting pre-release stuff. this happened from time to time - sometimes marketing would sell off a car and the shit erp system wouldn't record the change. that car would then get prerelease and sometimes very broken firmware. i seem to recall another case where we just forgot to remove the prerelease materials from the official build, so all you had to do was look around. 

-

the early days of tesla, post-roadster, early model s and the start of model x were good times - everyone was trying to prove the technology worked, we were innovating and making something that hadn't been done before. things really started to shit the bed around the time we pivoted from model 3 plans to shipping model x first. the falcon wing doors were _such a shitshow_. they ended up delaying the program almost a year, hence why model 3 basically skipped all the usual phases a car goes through for validation. i mean, come on - you have bumpers falling off in the rain, the interior is a disaster, there's no instrument cluster which takes your eyes off the road - this list just goes on. 

-

tesla basically runs their entire business like a just in time compiler only they don't treat warnings or errors as failures. most groups in the company don't cross-communicate so there's a lot of duplication of effort.

i once got pulled into a meeting because a car burned down when it was attached to a supercharger and we didn't get a log out of the car. normally under some emergency circumstances the car will try to upload a log when it thinks shit has gone really badly, but in this particular case it was far enough away from a tower it had half 3G connection and had to upload a 30MB log via HTTPS POST. the car burned down before it even got to 10MB and the system was only designed for exponential backoff retries, not resumption of in-progress. elon was calm about it, but we had to justify why we never had time to address it - maybe it was because we were all busy making unsafe features work? 

-

also on the supercharger note - you can get blacklisted from using them if you charge on them all the time. that's because the supercharger bypasses the charging regulator boards and dumps directly into the pack at 300A/450v which creates a ton of wear on the battery. want to keep your range high? don't supercharge often. 

-

>do they define “too often”?


algorithm-based now - the ai shit i was working on took into account a lot of factors to determine if you were abusing it before i left. the criteria takes into account the state of many components in the car, your driving patterns and other details. or it did anyway. not even sure that stuff is running still - they rotated projects in and out of existence pretty rapidly. 

-

>what is elon like when stuff goes wrong due to his idiotic micromanagement and big stupid ideas?


he's never wrong. his ""open door policy"" was an invitation to catch you breaking rank. 

-

tesla was also in the news because they were doing cute shit like spinning up k8s clusters which had AWS IAM access to sensitive S3 buckets but wasn't ssl'd and the k8s mgmt api was available publicly. there were other teams running industrial control equipment with centos 7 an no hardening at all.

there was one time where a canadian kid stole the domain and redirected emails and managed to take over slack and a bunch of other shit because the idiot IT team didn't hide the registrar information or use something like markmonitor. the car-side stuff at least did full mtls at the time so it was ok, but lol did that kid get a lot of info. 


**** the new stuff:
****

Some more:

-
>thats just what i want, the car manufacturer monitoring how i drive the car i own and deciding that features should be turned off after i >have purchased it, that's a good feature.
you have no idea. any connected car is ripe for data harvesting and you (the consumer) should expect it going forward. on that note, china has a law in place that mandates all electric cars send real time telemetry to their government servers - model s/x/3, NIO cars and any other electric car if they're driving already complies with that law to be road certified. don't be surprised if that becomes a mandate in other countries 
-
for all the shit that went down at tesla, there were some positive aspects. everyone i worked with really cared about physical safety and we put a lot of effort into making sure the engineering was sound so nobody got hurt. if you subtract autopilot, and that's a big if, the car is generally well designed minus the fit and finish issues + interior, but i'd argue that's never been tesla's strong point anyway. the cars are fast, the 2013-2014 model s lines were really good, solid, basic cars. my last straw was the summon feature - i strongly believe a car you are not in, backing out on its own from a parking space with the current sensors is super dangerous.

i was making jokes with the tesla expats when ol' musky launched his roadster into space that you could see the gaps in the fit and finish without a telescope
-
just remembered some bits of trivia

* they took away our free snacks in deer creek and replaced them with shitty vendors
* said vendors food poisoned people often enough osha or whatever the body is shut them down
* people were so mad about the free cereal being gone they'd intra-office snail mail bowls of cereal from the factory and post pictures in slack
* deer creek's parking got so bad (too many people, not enough space) they hired permanent valets
* they were cited for the shitshow parking for fire safety violations (unconfirmed, but i believe it)
* elon publicly being a shitbag to trans people
* the first time we turned on real time telemetry for the dev fleet we caught somebody going 130mph over the san mateo bridge
* it networking so bad the company had permanent 5~8% consistent packet loss between various places (like, next rack)
* firmware git repo so large they had to mirror it (something like 2TB) 

-
depending on when and what features you got (and if you got a marketing used car) they could go as low at $40k after incentives - but totally agree with you. fit/finish issues have been a thorn in their side forever

the touchscreen is kind of a safety issue in that you have to look at it to touch it, stealing focus. tactile buttons for some functions would have been better 
-
the firmware repo was that size if you take into account a huge company, many devices in the car at play and incremental updates to firmware across all those devices + branches for people to do work in. i contributed to that mess by policy, not by choice, but whatever. i'd imagine they'd be smart enough to move to something like git lfs so it isn't as much of a pain

scale stuff:

tesla has a real thundering herd problem at this point. if you factor in common peak drive times for any region (bay area CA being the largest by pop) they have to weather something like 100k+ cars slamming servers all at once during rush hours. i saw this play out on some of the cj dashboards, it was fun to watch the production shit come to a grinding halt before they figured out they couldn't just-in-time the autoscale and had to provision ahead of time for peaks

i had to deal with marketing people sincerely asking me why we weren't going to run containers on the car in firmware. no, marketing, i don't care that the car would ""update faster"" or ""features would release faster""

a web front-end (we'll say it's a cms that's php-based) that needed $500k in WAF bullshit just so we didn't get pwned every 5 minutes

fragmented installs of splunk. i think i counted well over 20 installs for various departments before they finally hired a decent data scientist that cleaned it up

so many random java, django, .net services from various places, more than i could count and i had to touch a _lot_ of them with firmware. ActiveRecord controlling way way _way_ too much. i consider this probably one of tesla's biggest scale problems - i don't think they actually know or can track exactly what they're running server side at all - so you end up with teams running vmware, nsx, k8s, openstack, hyper-v.

a car that has a json parser implemented in bash 3 because <interpreted language> is dangerous in the car. there are some seriously magic shell scripts on that thing that probably 3 people in the company understand in full

nodejs was a thing for a while but quickly broke down once we reached the 20k car mark - ended up replacing a bunch of that stuff with a Go variant 
-


> bets on whether the fire was due to incompetence, act of nature, or deliberately set?

never attribute to malice what can more easily be explained by incompetence

>not surprised at all. earlier in Falcon 9 lifecycle at SpaceX, they kept having helium problems because the QC team kept signing off on >defective bottles and valves. do you think that attitude might have scared them into not saying anything?

absolutely. taking advantage of the ""open door policy"" was the fastest way to lose your job at tesla and from what i'm told, spacex, being run by the same guy was no different. there is so much pressure to ship on time they push people to work 14 hour days, 7 days a week - i did that for a while before i just couldn't take it anymore and just accepted being marked down in employee review for being late 

-
the openvpn problem is easy to get around thundering herd/scale issues if you design it correctly and know how to run a network. in theory, you could get around a lot openvpn scale issues if you use bridged networking, ipv6 on the inside, and some redundant dhcp servers to hand out leases - that kind of shit won't work in most cloud providers though so you stuck at running that crap in a datacenter.

tesla's issues around the services were many fold - the specifics would give away too much, but i'll say this: when you make all of your services depend on a single rdbms while simultaneously using the world's worst ORM, you get what's coming to you.

i poked around on a 3 a friend has and after looking at a packet cap it looks like they're doing ssl'd amqp - i didn't see any openvpn packets so i suspect they got wise to how shitty it can be, but lol at running connected car stuff directly over the internet outside a private apn or a tunnel 

-

>The staggering level of internal fragmentation reminds me of how PayPal was when I worked there in '09-15. They experimented for a few months with an ""agile product solutions"" team that basically >took ""we need a widget that does this"" orders and cranked out custom Java shit that never worked. 

that's basically tesla in a nutshell only, i guess it kinda works. every different team has some kind of different service where you can get data but none of it published anywhere, there are no standards, and everyone just loves to write their own client implementations because they don't trust you to do it right (sorry that we don't have a client in C++ which is mandated by policy for the car)

poking holes in the firewall was always super fun - i would describe, in full detail all ports, sources, destinations, have security assessments done, etc and somehow, still, the firewall cj's would fuck up the ports. i once spent, and this is not a joke, 3 weeks chasing a single port down - i think that email thread had 100 reply-all's, two video confs and me visiting the firewall cj in fremont before it was finally fixed 

-

>was there any sort of accountability for the devs there, or was it if you knew how to talk the talk you could bs your way through the ranks while producing nothing of value?
>was there any noticeable increase in the absurdity of musk's requests as time went on? anything particularly absurd he called for that was flat out shot down?

no, if you didn't do work it was really really obvious and they purged you quickly. that didn't mean it was any _good_ but if you produced you were generally left to your own devices as long as you weren't breaking builds - this seemed to be true of most engineering teams.

ol' musky did increasingly weird shit, but i wouldn't necessarily call it out of the ordinary for silicon valley - many folks, me included, for a time, viewed him as a bit of a Jobs-type. his behavior became really erratic around the time we wrapped up X and headed for 3 full steam - the more stuff piling on about autopilot, the more issues with the factory, the ongoing issues with X and then with 3 mfg, his ongoing spacex work - the dude really needs a nap and to just walk away from tesla at this point. its arguable he isn't running it successfully considering all the issues

* edit - running it successfully by silicon valley standards. too many issues to reach profitability because of really poor strategy and execution. too many people get wrapped up in his celebrity without really asking 'can he pull this off' which is the difference between him and Jobs - Jobs actually did shit

>yeah, i get that, it's just they make a product that will probably shit itself when the back end goes dark, and that product costs $65k-$120k so it's an outlier by sv standards.

the product shouldn't shit itself when the backend eventually goes dark - autopilot won't work, updates won't, remote phone shit won't but otherwise the driving and infotainment part of the car should still function if you pull the sim and put your own in. given how shit the firmware security is it'd be pretty easy to dump the firmware, compile up some statically linked tools for shits and just patch in your own services. there's been a few clever people on twitter who figured out you can run Go arm bins on the thing - after that it's just figuring out what crap you care about on CAN (if anything).

all that said, tesla did sell cars explicitly with the sim pulled and no network ever - service was always complaining to us because the ring logs on those cars would take hours to parse.

speaking of the ring logs - because there was no battery backed rtc, we had to stitch and best-guess times based on the intervals when the car _did_ have valid time and patch that into the logs serially before they could be imported. inaccuracies in the signal data could and did lead to all kinds of bullshit when somebody needed to be debug issues

This is a significantly more complete and thorough take on the same topic and can be considered to be a replacement for the original. 

When talking about most of Musk's ventures - the cash-burning Tesla, the lawsuit-ridden SolarCity, or the hopelessly impractical tunnel-digging operations, for example - the problems with these ventures are generally not very subtle and immediately obvious to the astute observer. However, his space ventures, under the SpaceX company banner, are given far more positive treatment - and some even go as far as to say that [SpaceX is proof that Tesla will succeed](https://qz.com/1299212/spacex-is-giving-wall-street-a-reason-to-bet-on-tesla/). After all, if they're able to corner the entire market with the world's most advanced technology that experts said was impossible now, and are going to build high-speed internet and a Mars base tomorrow, why can't they make an electric car company succeed? Unfortunately, this entire story is built upon a very faulty premise of what SpaceX is doing now and is capable of doing in the future, a story that is neck-deep in mindless hype and misinformation. In this post, I'm going to unpack that story and set the record straight, regarding both what the company is doing now and the plans it has for the future.

**Falcon 9**

* This is SpaceX's primary craft currently in operation, designed and built for NASA's [ISS cargo program](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SP-2014-617.pdf). A reasonably serviceable craft of the medium to heavy-lift class of rockets. If you look into the design choices made for this craft, you see that many of them seem to explicitly focus first and foremost on making a low-cost design. It uses simple and cheap engines on both its first and second stage, it is a very thin and long rocket (providing an aerodynamic benefit that improves payload capacity), its production heavily emphasizes vertical integration (in-house production), it favors simple off-the-shelf solutions over aerospace-grade designs and practices, and it recovers the first stage for reuse after flight.

* Although these design choices do lead to some price reductions relative to other comparable rockets, they are not without their downsides. In particular:
 * Although the engines SpaceX uses are cheap to produce and generally effective for simple missions, they tend to lack versatility; comparable craft with more advanced engines are generally vastly superior for missions with complex requirements - such as traveling into a higher orbit or deep space, or addressing unusual or particularly difficult mission requirements.

 * The thin, long, ""aerodynamic"" design improves payload capacity, but at the cost of leaving little room for modification of the craft. Changes to the vehicle such as increasing the length of the payload or adding another stage on top (both important enhancements that are required by important government customers) would cause the vehicle to be unstable in flight. Most other rockets are designed to be somewhat thinner and fatter to leave room for further changes to the architecture.

 * While vertical integration does tend to make basic operations cheaper, there is a reason that that approach is rarely used: it sacrifices flexibility and causes R&D costs to skyrocket. Rather than being able to buy and integrate technology developed by other companies into their own product offerings, a company that is highly vertically integrated will be forced to rely only on what it can produce in-house, which will generally be cheaper but significantly less capable than the competition. This is indeed what is seen in this instance: while the Falcon 9 provides a fairly inexpensive basic ride to orbit, its direct competitors (such as Atlas, Proton, and Ariane) are able to win many of their most lucrative contracts based on services that SpaceX simply isn't able to provide. And as it develops the ability to provide some of these services - prices increase.

 * While using some simplified or off-the-shelf technology is helpful, aerospace-grade technologies are used for a reason: despite being expensive and often unwieldy, they provide a level of safety or control that similar automobile or commercial-grade technology does not. An explosive example: using industrial steel structures that do not support cryogenic conditions [directly caused the CRS-7 failure](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/public_summary_nasa_irt_spacex_crs-7_final.pdf). A more subtle example: using simple software-based tricks in place of an expensive radiation-hardened, real-time synchronized flight control system makes the rocket far less robust to difficult environments - something which matters little in simple missions where all goes well, but is critically important for ensuring the success of complex missions with invaluable payloads (the kinds of missions which SpaceX has proven to be a fairly ineffective launch provider for).

* However, the vast majority of the hype for this rocket, and for the company itself, is based on the fact that the Falcon can land its first stage after flight (albeit at a ~30% cost to payload capacity), and that that first stage can be refurbished and used on another flight. Much misconception exists around this particular capability.

 * Few, if any working aerospace experts thought that landing a rocket was impossible. More than 25 years ago, the [McDonnell-Douglas DC-X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzXcTFfV3Ls) proved this technology. The Falcon 9's landing ability represents little more than an iterative upgrade on decades-old technology, a far cry from what most experts would call impossible.

 * Although landing a rocket is certainly impressive from a technical standpoint, the ultimate judge of the merits of the idea is the financial benefit; there is little mission benefit to reusability, so reusability makes sense only if there is a financial benefit to designing and launching reusable rockets. These financial considerations largely explain why most of the world's rockets are not reusable.

 * Although from a purely ""common sense"" perspective, it would make sense that it's better to recover an expensive piece of technology after use rather than just throwing it away, this is hardly how it plays out. The R&D costs of reusability are massive - in the case of SpaceX, $1 billion was spent on developing this capability. Significant damage is sustained to the craft in flight, requiring expensive repairs. Any attempt to make the craft more suitable for reuse tends to lead to expensive upgrades that drive up the base price, which are hardly offset by the savings in easier reuse. And enabling reuse often severely constricts design decisions for the rocket as a whole (the Falcon, for example, must have a very large upper stage, so that the first stage can land before it accelerates enough to be too fast for a soft landing). For rockets, simply discarding rocket components after they have completed their task is the correct decision from both a financial and a mission perspective.

 * One of the most notable yet subtle costs of reuse is that the rocket manufacturer must now keep two separate supply lines open: one to service refurbishing of previously used rockets, and one to build new rockets and rocket components. Keeping both open is expensive, and running either one at reduced capacity (such as if few rockets are produced because many are reused) is a substantial expense. This leads to one of the most important rules in rocket reusability: it can only work at a consistent high flight rate (usually in the 30-40 launches per year range) because that is what is needed so that the fixed costs of running two supply lines does not dominate your expenses. Otherwise, more efficient production without reuse makes far more financial sense.

 * The costs of repairs tend to be dominated not by routine refurbishment but by unexpected, generally severe damage sustained during flights - something which becomes increasingly common upon multiple reflights. This likely explains why no Falcon mission before Block 5 has ever flown for a third time. Similarly, despite some expensive upgrades to support reuse, it is all but guaranteed that successive reuse attempts by even Block 5 will quickly become prohibitively expensive due to such significant damage after multiple uses. Previous promises made by SpaceX regarding rapid reuse of this craft (""launch, land, then launch again in 24 hours!"") significantly underestimate the repairs needed to ready the landed booster for flight - with such promises made well in advance of when they were able to actually analyze damage to the booster and have justification for making such claims. As data comes in that doesn't support these promises, they tend to be pushed further into the future (""block 5 will do it"" becomes ""this capacity will only be truly realized with BFR,"" etc).

* The market position of Falcon is explored in depth [in an earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8334qu/setting_the_score_straight_on_spacex_and_its_many/dvj5m8x/). Although SpaceX's prices are quite low relative to its US competitors and reasonably competitive on the international commercial launch market, their prices are hardly out of the norm - and driven in large part by the company's willingness to accept very small and even negative profit margins for their commercial sales. While useful, this largely demonstrates that Falcon is a craft that offers a lower-end budget option for satellite launches rather than a groundbreaking innovation in rocketry that makes all other rockets obsolete, as it is often hyped up to be.

**Dragon**

* A capsule used to deliver cargo to the ISS, currently being upgraded to support crewed flights as part of NASA's commercial crew program (currently scheduled to launch its first crew in 2019). Although somewhat mundane, its cargo version does more or less what it's intended to do - and the crewed version seems to be progressing reasonably well despite being quite late to launch relative to the initial schedule (as is its Boeing counterpart, the Starliner).

* Notably, prices on Dragon cargo deliveries [recently increased by 50%](https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-18-016.pdf) - at the same time that their competitors in cargo delivery have managed to reduce prices. These increases were largely due to increased costs of business for maintaining Dragon, along with an acknowledgment of the fact that they underbid in the past relative to their actual costs of doing business. This makes SpaceX the most expensive cargo delivery option among the three that were funded by NASA. While the increased price is still reasonably serviceable, it does largely show that the company is mostly offering an average service at an average price rather than some phenomenal discount.

* There are some very strict requirements for being able to launch crew - requirements that Dragon must be able to meet and that were agreed upon when NASA gave them a contract to develop that capability. Safety is key in manned missions, and what is often derided as ""paperwork"" holding up these launches is really a verification process that is necessary to ensure the safety of the astronauts that fly on these missions. These are the same requirements that exist for Boeing's crew vehicle, and not very different from the ones that exist for the Russian Soyuz manned flights (which differ primarily based on that the craft existed well before any NASA astronauts flew on it). As of now, the Soyuz is the only craft that is safe enough to launch manned missions to the ISS (even despite the launch abort in October), and this will remain true until at least one of the Commercial Crew vehicles is deemed to be certified to launch crew. Trying to skimp on the certification process is a great way to get astronauts killed by being too impatient to ensure their safety.

* NASA's certification process was also blamed for SpaceX's decision to drop propulsive landing from their offering for the crewed version of Dragon. In reality, [the technical challenges of propulsive landing from orbit](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130000774.pdf) are substantial, and it is unlikely that SpaceX was able to make enough headway with it to be able to support that capability. 

**Falcon Heavy**

* Falcon 9 with three booster cores, launched for the first time early this year. There were enough misconceptions about the first launch of this rocket that [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/7vurtd/clarifying_disinfo_on_falcon_heavy_launch/) was made to address them.

* Falcon Heavy is not capable of being a replacement for NASA's Space Launch System - to the lunar orbit that the SLS will launch the majority of its missions, SLS has about double the payload capacity, a much larger payload volume, and generally has made many design choices that make it far more suitable than other offerings for the kinds of lunar and deep space missions that it was designed for. Falcon Heavy is not even close to powerful enough to launch the 25-ton Orion crew vehicle to a lunar orbit, the most important cargo of the SLS, generally making it useless as a replacement to the SLS. Most suggestions of using Falcon Heavy focus around the idea of designing moon missions around that rocket, an approach that would severely constrict the lunar architecture in ways that would make it far less serviceable and far more expensive than if the SLS were to be used to launch them. 

* It is also not a replacement for the Delta IV Heavy - the DIVH is generally used for highly specialized missions that are loaded with special requirements. In terms of general Air Force requirements - the Falcon Heavy lacks the ability to vertically integrate payloads, to support a longer payload fairing, and its inefficient upper stage will *very* substantially reduce its payload capacity to difficult orbits such as a direct injection to GEO (likely below DIVH despite being a substantially larger rocket). Delta IV Heavy missions also generally have mission-specific requirements that justify spending $350 million on the launch that go well beyond payload capacity, requirements which SpaceX has generally struggled to be able to meet. For all the missions awarded for Delta IV Heavy to date, the Falcon Heavy would not have been a viable alternative.

* In practice, this gigantic rocket primarily competes against the most powerful configurations of Atlas V, or with the upper slot of the Ariane 5 rocket - essentially, for the larger payloads on rockets comparable in size to the Falcon 9. Despite Falcon Heavy's substantial size, it is a fairly awkward design that is primarily useful for launching payloads somewhat larger than what Falcon 9 normally launches. Indeed, many of the current Falcon Heavy missions will launch payloads small enough that Falcon 9 could launch them in its fully expendable configuration. 

**Starlink**

* This is a plan to launch thousands of communications satellites into low-Earth orbit, rather than the the traditional geostationary orbit, to reduce the latency of communications and to enable global high-speed internet access. Intelsat, one major satellite operator, published [this blog](http://www.intelsat.com/news/blog/leo-constellations-what-you-need-to-know/) that provides a lot of details as to the mechanics of these LEO constellations. In short: to enable that reduced latency, you gain a host of frighteningly complex and expensive logistical and technical issues. 

* [The story of Iridium](https://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-iridium-5615034/) from the 1990s is the best example of a LEO constellation that was a technical success, but that didn't manage to gain enough business to be a financial success. The nature of LEO satellites is such that you have to provide service to the entire world before you can provide service anywhere - and it takes a large contingency of customers all over the world to be willing to subscribe to this service to pay for it. Iridium significantly overestimated demand and never managed to pay off its startup costs. Eventually it declared bankruptcy, was sold for a pittance, and managed to become a marginally profitable business serving a fairly small government market. It's generally used as a cautionary tale for those who seek to launch grand satellite constellations and assuming that the market will align in your favor.

* More relevant to Starlink, however, is the Teledesic satellite internet constellation, which [was led by another ""visionary"" CEO](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/business/can-craig-mccaw-keep-his-vision-of-teledesic-from-crashing.html) but [ultimately failed to launch more than a test unit](https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Did-McCaw-and-Teledesic-aim-too-high-too-fast-1097421.php). The same story of not enough demand and sky-high capital expenditures played out here, as with the Iridium constellation - although the technical challenges were far more daunting.

* Notably, [a new batch of entrepreneurs](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/elon-musk-space-x-satellite-internet/) is attempting the same concept of satellite internet that failed in the 1990s and early 2000s. Most notable from that batch are OneWeb, the project that is furthest along and most conservative in design, and Starlink, the most ambitious and grandiose of the bunch.

 * OneWeb is a couple months from launch and has gone through the full process of designing and building its satellites. They managed to find buyers for their bandwidth, acquire rather cheap bulk launches on the Soyuz rocket, and bought Teledesic's license to its portion of the communication spectrum. But in that same time, their initial production price of [$500k per satellite](http://spacenews.com/one-year-after-kickoff-oneweb-says-its-700-satellite-constellation-is-on-schedule/) rose to [$1 million a pop](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/28/technology/airbus-oneweb-internet-satellites/index.html), forcing them to [forgo inter-satellite links](https://spacenews.com/oneweb-says-regulatory-concerns-main-reason-its-forgoing-inter-satellite-links/) as a means to reduce their costs - at the price of requiring ground stations all over the world to support their satellites (increasing latency substantially). Recently, they have been [vague about costs and financing requirements](https://spacenews.com/amid-concerns-oneweb-gets-vague-about-constellations-cost/) and only just now [announced some scaling back of the project](https://spacenews.com/oneweb-scales-back-constellation-by-300-satellites/). Although these are standard growing pains of an ambitious project, they represent the practical reality of what it actually takes to make even a rather conservative internet satellite constellation a reality.

 * What Starlink lacks in development relative to OneWeb, it makes up for in ambition. Instead of hundreds of satellites, Starlink has thousands, with the capacity of each satellite close to triple that of the OneWeb ones. Although it did launch two test satellites for the constellation, at the same time it [admitted a low state of maturity for the project](https://www.wsj.com/articles/spacex-indicates-satellite-based-internet-system-will-take-longer-than-anticipated-1519227620) - lacking a final design and any real cost estimates. Since then, rumors of significant turnover at the Starlink facility and of [a propulsion failure on the test satellites](http://tmfassociates.com/blog/2018/09/28/fake-it-till-you-make-it/) have been the most significant insights into progress of the program to date. Although significant hype about the capabilities of the constellation has been released, little has been offered in terms of visible progress towards the its realization.

* In practice, a combination of [high latency, high bandwidth GEO satellites](https://spacenews.com/viasat-details-1-4-billion-global-ka-band-satellite-broadband-strategy-to-oust-incumbent-players/) and [expanding wired internet infrastructure](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/heres-real-way-get-internet-next-4-billion-people/) will cover much of the market that these satellite internet constellations hope to serve. 

 * In most of the world, a wired connection is a far more efficient means by which to connect to the internet. Cables are far cheaper than satellites, capacity can easily be increased incrementally or very quickly, and maintenance for cables is far simpler than for satellite infrastructure (both ground and space). And even the [15 millisecond](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/spacex-sets-sights-lower-orbit-starlink-broadband-networks-first-satellites/) theoretical (speed-of-light transmission) latencies promised by Starlink pale in comparison to the *microsecond* latencies that wired can offer over similar distances. In practice, wired latency is much larger due to other latencies inherent to network communications, but this is also true for satellites - the latency of Iridium satellites averages [around 200 ms](http://dodccrp.org/events/10th_ICCRTS/CD/papers/233.pdf) despite a ""theoretical"" latency closer to 40 ms. While the LEO constellations can offer an impressive latency for a satellite, in practice a wired connection is almost certain to be far more efficient.

 * Nevertheless, there are communication needs that require satellites, as there are limits in the reach of existing wired infrastructure - ships, aircraft, and rural areas are not so easily wired in. However, most applications are not particularly sensitive to latency, and having to wait a couple seconds for internet or text communications (as would be expected from GEO communication satellites) is not particularly troubling. There are only a couple of applications that truly require low latency - such as high-frequency trading, video conferencing, and online gaming. Even then, however, high-speed internet is more of a luxury than a necessity if basic low-speed service is available. While LEO internet certainly does have a niche it can fill, often GEO satellites can provide a lesser but adequate service for a small fraction of the cost.

* Unlike Iridium, which was designed around a very robust (but low-bandwidth) portion of the RF spectrum, the high-bandwidth internet satellites have to use a far more fragile portion of the spectrum that [is highly vulnerable to atmospheric effects](http://www.waves.utoronto.ca/prof/svhum/ece422/notes/20b-atmospheric.pdf). On top of the fact that at any given point in time 80% of the constellation will be over uninhabited terrain and relatively unusable, the bandwidth will be reduced and the latency will be increased by these effects. Indeed, one major [proposed expansion to Starlink](https://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=1190019) involves communication that requires a direct line of sight - and will certainly suffer from even the most minor of service interruptions.

* By far the most daunting challenge of these internet constellations, however, is that of ground infrastructure. For LEO internet, a high-end antenna known as a [phased-array antenna](http://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via/may-june-2017/phased-array-antennas-can-they-deliver/) is necessary to be able to acquire and communicate with a whole constellation of satellites. Being able to install these antennas cheaply is key to being able to service LEO internet, and [prices are still quite high](https://spacenews.com/satellite-antenna-companies-divided-on-near-term-feasibility-of-cheap-flat-panels/). The goal for OneWeb and Starlink has been a still somewhat pricey $1000 per household unit, at the same time that prices hover around the $40,000 range and price reductions are quite slow. No surprise, given that this is a very complex antenna that until recently was only viable for high-end military applications - but without it there is little to no feasible way to actually communicate with LEO internet constellations. Compared to the fairly simple metal dishes that are needed for GEO satellite service, the installation costs for phased-array antennas will be prohibitively expensive for many potential customers of the service and threaten to kill the project before you even consider anything that actually has to go to space.

* In the face of these myriad technical challenges, the optimistic, grandiose plans appear rather farcical. There is little in the way of visible progress towards even the same level of maturity as OneWeb has reached - a level that has proven to still be quite far from demonstrating a viable business venture - but the promises grow more and more grand even as there is little proof that even the most basic of Starlink's plans can be realized. It is very dubious that anything can ever come of the project, much less generate the tens of billions of dollars in profit from satellite internet that SpaceX alleges the venture will make (allowing them to fund their Mars plans). 

**BFR**

* The rocket (by many names) that Musk proposes will not only allow humans to colonize Mars, but with its super-cheap service and versatility, will fulfill all current needs in space - including satellite launches, ISS cargo deliveries, space tourism, and even air travel! An idea so deeply and thoroughly in the realm of science fiction that it does not need debunking, but for the sake of completeness, I'll give it a go.

* As something of an aside, the BFR is often touted as an answer to NASA's expensive SLS project. I think it worth taking a moment to discuss the latter craft due to its relevance in the advocacy of the former.

 * It's not hard to list a slew of problems plaguing the SLS: it's expensive to develop (tens of billions of dollars) and launch ($0.5-1 billion), it has significant delays in development, there are clear missteps in the management of the program by all parties involved (NASA, Congress, and contractors), there is a lot of gray area in its future use beyond its first few missions (the [entire roadmap](https://i.redd.it/40jjusmjq5x11.jpg) past EM-2 is shaky, much less the schedule), and even its proponents will find plenty wrong with its implementation. All of these criticisms are valid, as these are problems with the program.

 * But on the other hand, there are a couple of key advantages of the program. It has a well-developed, low-risk design, requiring little in the way of new technology to implement. While future space architectures may be more efficient, the SLS can be designed and built now, rather than decades from now. And for all the problems you can find with the SLS, it's worth noting that they are primarily problems of routine development and logistics, a reality of any development work on the scale of that rocket. Despite the many missteps and challenges of the program, it is clear that the overall result has been visible, substantial progress in the construction of a rocket far more powerful than anything that exists today.

* Unlike the SLS, the problems with the BFR design are immediately obvious and fundamental, rather than logistical. At least a few come to mind:

 * The ability to land both the rocket and the spaceship are essentially taken for granted because of the success of Falcon 9's landings, even though the challenges will be far more daunting than they are for the former. Landing the rocket is primarily a problem of scale and of trajectory design, which will certainly impose significant restrictions on the design of the spacecraft. Landing of the spacecraft is far, far tougher - it has all of the same problems of propulsive landing as discussed for Dragon, but with a craft that is much larger with a higher center of gravity, landing on a planet that may or may not have a sufficiently flat or level landing zone available to support landing, using liquid engines that are guaranteed to cause significant stability issues upon use. If even the much easier task of propulsive landing for Dragon has proven to be so difficult as to be not worth completing, landing the spacecraft is an order of magnitude harder.

 * The [issue of radiation](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/real-martians-how-to-protect-astronauts-from-space-radiation-on-mars), is largely ignored or dismissed as ""not that big of a deal"" - when it is in fact one of the most important and vital concerns for human deep-space travel.

 * Few details are provided into the architecture that would enable the in-orbit refueling that is key to Mars missions. It is largely assumed to be as simple as putting two spacecraft together and pumping fuel over, when the reality is that any such craft will be a rocket that houses the infrastructure of a space station. Somewhat similar, perhaps, to [what the Space Shuttle was capable of doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/94ue8e/the_space_shuttle_a_fairer_analysis/), but this requirement alone makes it a craft even more complex than the most complex rocket ever built to date.

 * Whereas most large rockets tend to favor a small number of very powerful engines that can be tested individually, the BFR uses 31 relatively small engines on its first stage. This is a configuration that cannot be tested properly until all of the engines are installed and fired together - and only then will it be possible to analyze and perfect the design of the plumbing between the engine and the fuel tanks (a task which will certainly prove to be as tough as making the engines themselves).

 * The BFR promises to do everything for everyone before even its basic design is in place and it can fulfill its core functions. That is a clear sign of ambition overriding common sense.

* Even for the components of the BFR that *have* seen some development, the news tends to be a significant reduction in promises of capability. The Raptor engine has shrunk in size by up to 50% from its original promised specifications, its specific impulse (fuel efficiency) has dropped by at least 10 percent, and the vacuum variant of the engine has been removed from development. Even the carbon fiber design, a fairly straightforward (but expensive) portion of the project often touted as proof of progress of the BFR, [has been cancelled](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1071572534921900033). Since the design has largely depended on the most optimistic result possible for each key technical development, each of these problems has required a full re-architecture of the entire system on the cadence of one redesign per year.

* The design of the BFR would not pass scrutiny in even a preliminary design review as would generally be conducted for a large aerospace project. The problems are immediately obvious, and the scale and quantity of them makes the entire design DOA. It would be clear that even slight setbacks in the project (an inevitability) would sink the entire design, and there is no shortage of aggressive promises being made. These design reviews are done in order to avoid the exact kind of situation that BFR is facing: when you put in effort ahead of actual development to make sure that you have a design that is sufficiently robust to survive the challenges of development and production, you won't have to throw out everything and work on a complete redesign whenever you run into a snag in your approach. Evidently little work was put into any formal design of BFR, as a redesign every year seems to be the name of the game.

* At the end of the day, as problematic as the SLS is, it represents a rocket that is real and that will be developed with the capabilities it promises to have. It might not be glamorous like the BFR, but it has the advantage of being real and feasible.

**General**

* The finances of the company do not show any obvious benefit from company operations. [This WSJ piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/exclusive-peek-at-spacex-data-shows-loss-in-2015-heavy-expectations-for-nascent-internet-service-1484316455) shows minuscule margins in successful years and highly negative margins in unsuccessful years, with significant cash raises being necessary to support the business. [This disclosure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-19/elon-musk-s-spacex-is-said-to-cut-loan-deal-by-500-million) as part of a capital raise shows that even in SpaceX's best year (after reusability was developed, with a very high launch cadence) its earnings are negative. This shows that even with all the promises of technologies reducing the cost of access to space, the reductions seem to largely be sustained by accepting unprofitable margins, and requiring constant capital raises (in both equity and debt financing) to stay afloat.

* SpaceX's failures are generally followed by conspiracy and a desire to pin the blame on others. For their three total failures to date:

 * The supplier of the strut that caused the CRS-7 failure was blamed, when the true blame lies with the company that used the product on their rocket without first ensuring that it was suitable for that purpose.

 * During the AMOS-6 failure, SpaceX [pushed a conspiracy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/implication-of-sabotage-adds-intrigue-to-spacex-investigation/2016/09/30/5bb60514-874c-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html) that snipers from ULA (a competitor) shot down their rocket. 

 * The Zuma failure was rebranded as a ""partial success"" and later a ""success"" because the culprit of that failure was a payload adapter provided by the customer. Even though this still makes the launch a total failure, the SpaceX fanbase [vandalized Wikipedia](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/7pntop/zuma_total_failure_rebranded_as_partial_success/) by aggressively insisting that this failure must be treated as a success, out of an explicit desire to change the facts to support a more SpaceX-favorable narrative.

* Deliberate disinformation is a key tenet of SpaceX's PR strategy, consisting primarily of cultivating reporters that post uncritically positive articles about the company and uncritically negative ones of their competition, with stories often being fed in support of such a narrative. 
 * As a couple of quick examples: [SpaceX undercuts ULA prices by $350 million](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/air-force-budget-reveals-how-much-spacex-undercuts-launch-prices/) ([Blatant lie](https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/875720494313373697)), [Russia gives up in launch market to SpaceX](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/russia-appears-to-have-surrendered-to-spacex-in-the-global-launch-market/) ([mistranslation and editorializing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arianespace/comments/8det9p/russia_appears_to_have_surrendered_to_spacex_in/dxml9gr/)), [how to build a moonbase in four years](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-moon-direct-how-to-build-a-moonbase-in-four-years/) (trivializing spacecraft design as explained in the above Falcon Heavy section), and [50 percent market share](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a27290/one-chart-spacex-dominate-rocket-launches/) ([fraudulent graph made by SpaceX](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8334qu/setting_the_score_straight_on_spacex_and_its_many/dvjdaw5/)).

 * As easy it is to refute these articles, in the time it takes to do so they are generally picked up by a dozen publications and repeated uncritically, being burned into the mind of SpaceX fans as truth. Deliberate misinformation is a large part of the company's PR strategy supporting its supposed grand success.

* The global satellite market is seeing and for the last few years has been seeing a sustained decline. In just December 2018, you can find new articles on [operators reducing purchases](https://spacenews.com/directv-owner-att-says-its-done-buying-satellites/) and [downsizing at a major satellite producer](https://spacenews.com/maxar-schedules-spending-break-after-worldview-legion-completion/). The past two years are full of these articles, and it largely means that after the batch of satellites ordered since around 2016 are launched (generally 2-3 years after purchase), the next years will see a steep decline in commercial launch cadence. This is exactly the pattern you see in SpaceX's launch manifest: large launch orders right now based on contracts scored in the past years, but few new orders and a shrinking manifest in the years to come. Most of the big players in the space business are dealing with this shortage with layoffs and focusing on winning large government orders to deal with the reduction in business.

* To the surprise of many observers, SpaceX didn't win [a development contract for the Air Force's LSA program](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/9n46xa/air_force_launch_contract_winners_ula_orbital/).
 
 * Some fans say that this is because SpaceX already has all the capabilities to satisfy Air Force requirements, which clearly isn't the case (as described in the Falcon Heavy section of this post). While those capabilities could be developed, it is expensive to do so (hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially $1 billion) and would be best done with money provided for that precise purpose. Now SpaceX will either have to front these costs out of pocket to have a chance to bid (a questionable financial decision), or give up Air Force business entirely after 2022.

 * Since Falcon is a fairly small technical risk relative to some of the other winners, it is rather interesting that it was not selected for this program. The two leading theories as to why include that SpaceX bid only the BFR for that program, and that this was a result of Musk publicly smoking marijuana in violation of the rules doing business with the government. The Air Force does not release the justification behind their decisions, so we will never be told exactly why the LSA awards were given out as they were. But on the latter theory, I will say this much: these awards are as much about who can be trusted as about the rocket itself, and smoking marijuana [doesn't engender trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/9zb3i9/nasa_was_so_unamused_by_elon_musks_pot_smoking/ea7tccw/), nor does a baseless accusation of pedophilia directed towards rescue workers, nor Tesla's current troubles with the SEC (e.g. ""funding secured""). Whatever the ultimate justification for the final decision, these problems do not engender trust, and absolutely, definitely played a role in the decision.

**Conclusion**

At first glance, SpaceX made a pretty decent rocket and space capsule, offered interesting developments for reusability, and brought an interesting cost-cutting philosophy to the table. But as you dig deeper into how the company works, you start seeing significant problems. The plans for the future are based on completely unfeasible ideas, promoted and hyped until the reality of those ideas force them to scale back and delay these promises. Their approach to hype and to the media relies on conspiracy and misinformation, in the process causing harm to other projects, often far more important than the services the company actually provides, as people assume that SpaceX's blue-sky promises will all pan out and make everything else obsolete. And as time has shown, the company is nowhere near as successful as it is made out to be, bringing some interesting chips to the table but at the same time being significantly overhyped and based on unfavorable financials. 

In short, SpaceX is not unlike Tesla or any of Musk's other ventures: it's cool and flashy, and brings something interesting to the table, but is not viable and survives more on hype than on the merits of its business. It's just done a better job of convincing people otherwise."

* We didn't get a rocket to Mars.
* No manned flights around the moon. No manned flights at all, actually. But [that didn't stop him from selling flights around the moon, now for 2023](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45550755).
* Instead of 500,000 Teslas, [we got about 250,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/).
* No 10GW of panels out of the Buffalo ""gigafactory"" in New York. In fact, [that's kind of a massive fuck-up boondoggle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-20/inside-elon-musk-s-forgotten-gigafactory-2-in-buffalo).
* No self-driving Tesla crossed the USA, not with Tesla's hackjob lidar-less version of it. [Another company did make it from LA to Jacksonville, though](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/embarks-self-driving-truck-drove-2400-miles-across-the-u-s/).
* The [15 mile Boring Co hyperloop tunnel in LA was cancelled](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/11/28/elon-musks-boring-co-drops-one-its-l-tunnel-plans/2135781002/), instead of completed.  We instead got a 1.1 mile 1-lane unidirectional car tunnel without safety egress. It took 2 years. [And the public unveiling was a bad joke](https://jalopnik.com/what-the-actual-shit-was-that-1831214583).
* On the other hand, [we did see a souped up hypermiled Tesla go 606 miles on a charge](https://bgr.com/2018/05/29/model-3-range-record-hypermiling-606-miles-video/). Not quite the 620 promised. But close enough, I'll give it to him. That puts him at 1/7 for 2018.

What did Musk do in 2018 instead?

* [Smoked a spliff on the Joe Rogan podcast](https://imgur.com/qp0NkQA.png). As you do when you work 120 hours per week with a half-dozen important job titles.
* [Got charged with fraud](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and settled, for saying he'd take Tesla private at $420 per share (smoke bees erryday, y'all)
* [Got sued by a cave diver](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/business/elon-musk-sued-pedophilia-accusation.html) who rescued trapped children after repeatedly calling him a pedophile on Twitter. [Then just kept doing it for months](http://fortune.com/2018/09/04/elon-musk-pedo-tweet-pedophilia-accusations-diver/).
* [Built a hollow steel dildo he called a ""mini-submarine""](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a22150734/elon-musks-mad-mini-submarine-didnt-help-thai-cave-rescue/) to get free publicity off of those trapped children, then got pissy when nobody wanted to use his unsolicited, impractical solution.
* Violated National Labor Relations Board rules by threatening to take employees stock options away if they unionize on Twitter, and over 2018 faced five separate hearings there, some cases of which are ongoing. [1](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-231690), [2](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-220777), [3](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-232333), [4](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-221643), [5](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-214300).
* [Cried in interviews](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amynelson1/2018/08/29/elon-musk-cries-about-his-tears/#543428da3d56), then went on Twitter to deny he cried. [Then went on 60 minutes](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/elon-musk-went-on-60-minutes-and-cried-about-his-tweets.html) and literally cried about Twitter.
* [Got sued by investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-04/musk-isn-t-keen-on-investors-dragging-girlfriend-into-tweet-suit?srnd=technology-vp), including major state pension funds, who are literally subpoenaing his girlfriend and rapper Azealia Banks over his Twitter bullshit.
* Coined the term ""production hell"" to describe...well, actually, just building cars. [Then admitted he nearly bankrupted Tesla](https://nypost.com/2018/11/26/elon-musk-tesla-nearly-went-bankrupt/), the company he sued to claim he founded in 2009.

What whacky deliverables did we get for 2019?

* [A refresh of the Tesla Roadster that can hover](https://electrek.co/2019/01/09/tesla-roadster-hover-off-the-ground-elon-musk/). Why not, right?
* [A Tesla supercharger network covering 100% of Europe](https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-supercharger-europe/#WIKHTHgROmqB), including Ukraine. Because that's what a broke, invaded, war-torn country needs. Fast-chargers for luxury sedans.
* [Interplanetary ""Starship"" test flights](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starship-new-heights-elon-musk-q1-2019-hop-test-debut/). That he's saying will happen by April. Looks like a butt plug.
* [A Tesla Truck](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/elon-musk-tweets-about-tesla-pickup-truck-prototype-for-2019.html). He already [sold a bunch of these](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/03/27/tesla-semi-truck-preorders-fedex-customers.html) to FedEx last year for several million dollars. So that ought to be fun to watch.
* [Model Y unveiling](https://www.foxbusiness.com/luxury/tesla-model-y-what-we-know-so-far), he says in March, along with the elusive $35k Model 3 which is now to be built in Shanghai at Gigafactory 3 (1's the Reno battery plant and 2 is the solar plant he forgot about in Buffalo, for those following along). Of course, the Model Y was a crossover on a Model 3 chassis announced in 2015 to complete the ""S3XY"" branding, so we'll see.
* [Mars. Again](https://www.upi.com/Elon-Musk-plans-to-launch-spacecraft-for-Mars-in-2019/2401520836057/). This is an annual treat.
* [Manned flights to the space station by April](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/spacex-vows-to-launch-manned-flight-to-space-station-in-2019). We've heard this tune before too.
* [Breaking ground on a ""loop"" tunnel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/us/chicago-tunnel-elon-musk-rahm-emanuel.html) under Chicago at would carry 16-person ""skates"" for $25 each way along the existing Blue Line from O'Hare to downtown. Of course, [that was supposed to begin already](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17465570/elon-musk-boring-company-chicago-tunnel-project).
* [The elusive $35k Model 3. Again](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-base-trim-production-2019/). This is another annual treat that was supposed to happen years ago. Still costs $49k. He's [""guessing"" now it'll come out mid-2019](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-guesses-tesla-model-3-will-arrive-midyear-1544461065).
* [Autodrive 2.0 or whatever on all vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/03/11/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-self-driving-next-year/) by the end of the year. [This one's supposed to be able to go across the country on its own. Again](https://electrek.co/2018/09/18/tesla-fully-self-driving-cross-country-road-trip-version-10-alpha-elon-musk/). So predictable [the headlines can't help it](https://jalopnik.com/tesla-delays-coast-to-coast-autonomous-demo-drive-again-1828041207). Oh, and [the cars will read signs & park themselves](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/10/31/elon-musk-tesla-electric-cars-autopark/1834305002/). Because of course they will.
* [500,000 cars per year. Again](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/91682826-132.html). This was last year's promise & they got halfway. A million by 2020, he says.
* [Volume production of the ""solar roof.""](https://www.inverse.com/article/51961-2019-tech-predictions-tesla-solar-roof-ships-in-two-more-designs) They started taking pre-orders years ago. And the cost can run upwards of $100k (5 times what solar panels would cost, and 20 times an asphalt shingle roof). [They closed a bunch of facilities and pulled out of a lot of states](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/tesla-to-close-a-dozen-solar-facilities-in-9-states-documents.html) and their sales partnership with Home Depot, so who wants to take bets on this one?
* [Don't forget the Baltimore to Washington tunnel](https://wamu.org/story/17/10/20/elon-musk-start-digging-hyperloop-tunnel-maryland/).
* Start paying off [a metric buttload of debt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312514084484/d686051d8k.htm) in March, survive [the tax credit phase out](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a23743195/tesla-tax-credit-deadline-date/), and a [flurry of new competition](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1120745_here-are-the-electric-car-models-on-the-way-for-2019), and still increase in revenue and [sustain profitability](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322303).

Anyways, there's probably more I'm forgetting, but there's a New Year's list for now. Thanks to the mods for their work. And thanks to /u/Buffalo__Buffalo for reminding me to do a 2019 update.

"2056","2019-07-01","Yes, SpaceX really did falsify test documents. No, I am not an incompetent, raving lunatic that was going to shoot people at work.","(I originally posted this to r/spacex, but it showed up as \[removed\])

For  over five years, I have been dealing with the repercussions of reporting falsified test documents when I worked at SpaceX.  Given what  happened to me, it's highly unlikely that other technicians would ever be willing to come forward to report similar problems.

During the wrongful termination trial (Blasdell v Space Exploration Technologies), I actually did find a well documented incident that was easier to understand than most of the other examples.  In that one incident, I was testing a part, and the test failed.  I notified the necessary people that the test had failed.  Afterward, somebody else  marked the test as ""Pass"" anyway, and used *my initials* to sign for it!  When I found out, I forwarded the information to my management team via email, including a screenshot of the document with my initials that were entered by somebody else.  A manager (Christopher Tafel) replied, acknowledging what happened.  No known action was taken to identify or discipline the person who committed fraud, but I was fired within three  weeks.  The email chain that proves this happened has been sealed by the court, out of public view.  The email chain does not contain proprietary information or sensitive rocket technology.  It contains proof that I reported undeniable fraud just three weeks before I was  fired.  Fortunately, the trial transcript does include a discussion of that email chain, when Mr. Tafel was questioned about it, and acknowledged that it really did happen (court reporter transcript page 3846 line 14, through page 3827 line 15).

That was just one example of fraud.  Many of the other examples were excluded from evidence.  My own testimony was restricted by court orders about what I was or was not allowed to say.  I had several current and former SpaceX employees willing to testify or provide statements to back  up my story, until SpaceX's lawyers called each one of them 'as a courtesy to help schedule their depositions'.  After these 'courtesy  calls', not one single person would go on the record to speak about what happened.

I've read news articles referring to me as a ""paranoid technician"", largely thanks to testimony from SpaceX's expert witness, Dr. Mark Kalish.  Dr. Kalish was paid $30,000 to testify.  He said I was paranoid, schizophrenic, and psychotic.  I'm pretty sure this was also him: [https://lawenforcementproblems.blogspot.com/2012/08/psychiatrists-talk-of-rap-sheet-voids.html](https://lawenforcementproblems.blogspot.com/2012/08/psychiatrists-talk-of-rap-sheet-voids.html) (link to a story about Dr. Kalish's testimony being so unreliable that he caused a conviction to be overturned).  It also didn't help that two of my managers (Mike Callas and Jose Carvajal) started emailing HR, suggesting I might come in to work shooting.  I didn't find out about that until a couple of those emails were added into a new version of my employee file, after I got lawyers.

Due to contracts with my own attorneys (they handled all media contact themselves), I have been unable to publicly defend myself against any of this nonsense.  I lost the trial, I lost the appeal, and a few weeks ago, my attorneys withdrew from the case.  I've been desparately trying to find new legal assistance, but once the appeal is decided, all  remaining options seem to disappear within a few weeks.  This is not enough time to find a lawyer willing to work on a case that's already been defeated twice, especially with short notice.  I had to take more than a week off from work to write the appellate Petition For Rehearing  myself, which was denied without explanation.  I have until Tuesday,  July 2nd, to send a Petition For Review to the California Supreme Court, but I can't write that document myself.

I'm having a hard time accepting that the US judicial system could let something like this happen.  I only have two days before all hope is  lost, and I still keep thinking there must be some mechanism to correct  this.  At this point, I just hope this gets read by somebody who can help me at least submit a Petition For Review.  If I can get a new  trial, there's hope that I might also find a new legal team.

I  reported fraud to SpaceX management, and as a result, I lost my professional and personal reputation.  That is a fact. I was fired in 2014.  My trial wasn't until 2017.  The appeal was this year, in 2019, and all I'm hoping for now is the ability to keep fighting for another five years.

If you actually read this entire post, I really want to thank you for taking the time to read it.  It's so much more complicated than I can describe in just a few paragraphs, but this should be a good start.

Sincerely,

Jason W. Blasdell"

Since we're just a bit over a month before the court date for the defamation suit by Vernon Unsworth, I thought I'd write up a bit of an effortpost to lay out what's happened so far, in preparation for following the events of the case.

# Background

The story started in the summer of last year when a team of child soccer players found themselves trapped in a cave in Thailand, that was only accessible through diving underwater. The events were a big part of the news at the time, and there was a major rescue operation assembled, including assistance by Unsworth, an accomplished cave diver. Around the same time, Elon Musk decided that he wanted to be involved with the effort as well. He diverted resources from SpaceX to design a sealed capsule that was intended to hold one of the children and be pulled through the water to safety. The capsule idea was not requested (and ultimately not used), but Musk directed his team to build it anyway and kept trying to insert himself into the rescue effort.

Throughout the events, Unsworth was heavily critical of Musk's involvement. During a media interview, he stated that Musk's plan has ""absolutely no chance of working"", and that Musk should ""stick his submarine where it hurts"" for trying to interfere with the successful rescue of the kids. After hearing this, Musk lashed out on Twitter (as he often does against people and groups he doesn't like), calling the rescuer a ""pedo guy"". The accusation was essentially claiming that a white man of Unsworth's age would have no reason to live in Thailand, except to prey on children sexually. He later deleted the tweet and publicly apologized, but then decided to double down on the accusation several times, including:

* Simply claiming that it was still true, even though he had apologized for saying it.

* Betting a signed dollar to a fan on Twitter that it was true.

* Claiming that Unsworth not suing him was proof that it was true. Note that Unsworth's legal representation had already privately threatened to sue Musk at this point.

* Upping the accusations to not only pedophilia, but also child rape.

* Claiming to a Buzzfeed reporter that Unsworth had originally moved to Thailand for a child bride, that he said was 12 at the time.  Note that Musk offered this with a declaration that it was off the record, though journalism ethics require that both sides agree that something is off the record for it to actually be off the record. Unsworth's girlfiriend, 40 years old, later had to publicly state that she was very much ""of age.""

Over a year later, Musk has still not given any sort of evidence that anything he was saying was true.

# The Suit

Unsworth decided to sue Elon Musk for defamation, as the claims were not true, hurt Unsworth's reputation, and could have been done with the intent of helping Musk's own reputation. Musk's own legal representation filed a request for the case to be pre-emptively thrown out, on a number of grounds including:

* The insults were ""over-the-top"" and as such should have been interpreted as hyperbolic.

* The insults were made on Twitter, and as such shouldn't have been taken seriously.

* Musk had never met Unsworth, so no reasonable person should have believed Musk when he claimed to have private knowledge of Unsworth potentially being a pedophile.

* Defamation law doesn't apply to insults or opinion.

* Various other more-legal technicalities that are usually thrown into requests like this in a ""see what sticks"" approach.

The dismissal request was rejected by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson. Although the bit about defamation law not applying to insults or opinion was potentially Musk's strongest argument in his favor, the judge decided that Musk's repetition of the accusations, and confident claims that he was right (including a material bet), indicated that it was in fact *not* a matter of ""insults"" or ""opinion"", but rather that Musk legitimately believed that Unsworth was a pedophile, and was trying to convince people of this. As such, if Musk had not doubled/tripled/quadrupled down on the accusation and left it at the apology, he probably would have been not guilty of defamation.

# What Happens Now

In the decision to not dismiss the case, a court date was set for October 22, in which Elon Musk will potentially defend himself against the suit. On October 7, a pre-trial conference will be held. This is an event in which the two sides meet to discuss matters not relating to whether the defendant (Musk) is guilty or not. What this usually comes down to in a case like this is the prosecution (Unsworth) offering a settlement, in which the defendant agrees to some terms, that result in the case not going to trial. For example, Musk may have to pay some amount of money to Unsworth, publicly reaffirm that Unsworth is not a pedophile and that Musk had no evidence to suggest that this was the case, etc.

My personal belief is that Unsworth may choose not to offer a settlement, and will instead just let it go to trial. Settlements are typically made in cases where there's some sort of question as to whether the defendant will be found guilty, or if the potential damages from him being found guilty would not be worth the effort of bringing it to trial. However, in this case, Musk seems to have blown his entire argument already (in that the judge has already claimed that defamation law does apply here), and Unsworth has already expressed an interest in taking Musk to task for his actions, and actually doing something that could be considered punitive for someone as rich and powerful as Musk.

One thing to keep in mind is that, even though things are looking really good for Unsworth, the unexpected can still happen when it comes down to people as rich as Musk. Earlier this year, Musk and Tesla were taken to court on accusations of contempt of court, after they violated a previous settlement with the SEC from when Musk committed securities fraud last year. The settlement required any ""material"" information coming from Musk's Twitter to be reviewed by a securities lawyer, and this year Musk violated this by tweeting out false production predictions, without consulting the lawyer. In the contempt case, Musk's lawyers argued that, because the original settlement did not specify what ""material"" means, that responsibility falls by default to Tesla, who claims that *nothing* Musk could have said could have been material, and as such, it was impossible for Musk to ever violate the settlement, because everything he said was not ""material"", because Tesla said so. The court bought it, and Musk/Tesla got away with just having to renegotiate the settlement to strictly define what was ""material"".

So, what it comes down to is that Unsworth has a really good case against Musk, and the judge has already shown that he's not buying Musk's argument, but it'll all come down to whether Musk is able to weasel his way out in court again, like he's done in the past.

**TLDR:**

* Elon Musk tried to insert himself into the Thai soccer team rescue mission, and upon being excluded, repeatedly called one of the rescue divers a pedophile and child rapist, with no evidence.

* The diver is suing for defamation. Musk tried to get the case thrown out and failed, potentially blowing his entire argument.

* The pre-trial conference is on October 7th, at which point Unsworth may offer a settlement, or may not.

* The court date is October 22nd, in which Musk will defend himself against the defamation suit (if he doesn't take a settlement, or if a settlement is not offered)."

"235","2020-02-11","What companies are doing what Musk claims Tesla is doing?","I don't know about anyone else, but my biggest issue with Musk is that acts like he's making these huge improvements to help the planet, but he's really not. 

Most greenhouse gas pollution (from my understanding) is related to transporting goods and growing meat, not individual transportation. So if you were a multimillionaire or billionaire that wanted to make a significant step towards reducing global warming and other environmental problems, you would be better off investing in green transportation systems (ie, rail lines) or giving giant bags of money to companies like Gardien, MorningStar Farms, Quorn, or whoever is making lab grown meat. Reasonably, he might have just wanted to combine an interest in cars and the environment, which I would be OK with in theory since it could still help the environment, but his cars are priced so high that most consumers cannot get them, which reduces the possible benefit. If you wanted to say something about playing the long game and needing to start with luxury models to generate interest (which I'm still basically OK with as a possible argument for the positives of Musk/Tesla), mining lithium for the batteries is terrible for the environment, and dangerous work mostly done in Africa with minimal health and safety considerations. And as far as I'm aware, Musk has not made any investments in alternatives to Lithium-Ion batteries or ways to improve the environmental or health aspects of mining lithium. There's also something to be said for the environmental impacts of a fully electric car when coal is a significant source of consumer power for people. And on I could go.

My point is: I hate Musk/Tesla/Musk fanboys mostly because they claim they're trying to help save the environment, and Musk has the resources to make a huge impact in that regard, but the way he's trying to do that is almost fractally bad at doing that.

This is all a surprisingly long winded way of asking: what companies or organizations out there are doing what Musk/Tesla claim they are doing? Who actually *is* making notable strides in fixing the things that cause global warming and other environmental disasters?"

Honestly, when I found out he was having a kid, I was happy for the dude. He’s a shitty guy but he’s human and I wasn’t gonna bash him when his kid was being born. I may hate him but I’m a human being as well. 

Then I find out he’s naming the baby some random crap like this... ok, really fucking weird, but he’s a newborn child. Still didn’t want to complain about a literal baby.

And then I find out it’s not a joke.. he’s actually naming his kid this as a lame attention grab. It doesn’t benefit the kid at all. It’s literally just free PR for Elon and Grimes.

And it fucking worked. Reddit and Twitter ate it up. All of a sudden, he’s their golden boy again. Making stupid overused memes about him being a robot and stuff. “This is what we see on the back of the router!!!!” “Elon named him using a minecraft enchantment table!!!” “this is so funny!!! wholesome 100!!!”

Even that, I can stand. But what’s unbearable is how they’ve COMPLETELY forgot about all the misinformation he spread and how he endangered countless people for himself to succeed. It’s gone. Swept under the rug. If you bring it up again, they’ll label you a blind hater. It’s as if it never happened. He’ll never face consequences for his actions, he just has to do something that has even remote meme potential and the internet sucks him off.

People are not even acknowledging that there was a whole team that worked years on this and, to top it all, Elon never mentioned a single name from the team in any of the press conferences.

EDIT: So this topic kinda blew up way more than I expected it to do. Let me make some additional points after seeing all the replies - 

&#x200B;

1. I am not a Musk hater. I actually kinda admire him for having guts to start innovative businesses, but I still stand by my point that he has done an absolutely poor job at giving credit to others. Sure, you can give me a few tweets or maybe a small interview in which he takes like 2 seconds to thank the team, but that's it. Some people mentioned Gwynne Shotwell, whom I never even knew, even when I have been following SpaceX for over 6 months now. If a guy who has followed your company for 6 months does not about her, how do you think that average joe would? If that doesn't tell you that this is an issue, then you are biased.
2. There is a disturbing trend on social media and people in the tech industry that thinks Elon Musk is some kind of lord and savior who works 100 hours a day and creates rockets and teslas from hand. There are some people in this thread who said he is a modern-day Isaac Newton, which is completely ridiculous. He is the CEO, not the inventor. This honestly disturbs me as it totally discounts the work done by others and portrays him as some kind of Messiah, and he has DONE NOTHING to counter this.
3. He shits on others for absolutely no reason but to gain publicity and advertise his cult of personality. He publically said that superhuman AI is achievable and would be the end of human civilization, while every AI expert has said that we are decades away from such a technology. When asked, he always gives childish remarks as if his ego is hurt. And his supporters just blindly believe what he says. 

I can go on but you get the point."

>And those aren't even moderates. Kevin McCarthy for example is a climate change denier: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/17/climate-change-denial-scepticism-republicans-congress

>Musk also donates to Democrats (he donates far more to Republicans though), but his donations to Democrats are to a large part to right-wing democrats (Diane Feinstein and Bill Nelson among them) to assist in driving the party to the right. Bill Nelson is the same guy who described single-payer as being ""too good of a deal for the American people"".

>> I attended a dinner discussion a few years ago in Atherton featuring Larry Page and Elon Musk. A small group of Silicon Valley technology leaders attended. I felt out of my depth, but forced myself to ask a question that might elicit patronizing glances. It did. >> >> What would it take to get visionaries like them deeply engaged in the real problems of humanity — poverty, mass incarceration, violence against women — that, because of market failures, don’t offer much money to their solvers? >> >> I was expecting them to discuss market-based solutions, prizes like those the X Prize Foundation and Innocentive are putting up. Prize models have worked well to divert private capital to public solutions, like vaccines. >> >> Instead, Elon looked at me with a grin and said, “I’m not sure poverty is such a problem. I grew up in South Africa and now live near Beverly Hills. The housewives in my neighborhood are certainly more miserable than the kids I saw playing in the townships growing up. It’s relative.” >> >> I was so shaken by the absurdity and apocryphal nature of his comments that I didn’t respond for a few minutes. To his credit, Larry did, laughing and pointing out how wrong his friend was. Study after study has demonstrated, through methods like cortisol testing and massive surveys, that suffering from poverty is only relative above a certain baseline — below this baseline, poverty absolutely causes human suffering. Denying this basic fact is denying the human worth of several billion people on our planet.

I’m not saying Musk is 100% a pedo or that he was even directly involved with Epstein’s operations. This is simply a compilation of sources and concrete evidence that Musk has been heavily involved with Epstein in the past. All of this is publicly available information that I was able to find from credible sources. For all we know, there could be even more behind closed doors. Interpret this collection of facts as you will.*

With the recent arrest of Ghisline Maxwell, [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/UPwXMyS.jpg) 
has been making the rounds on the Internet. People have been replying to his tweets with it and it’s been posted multiple times here. Every time someone posts it, Elon and his fans get extremely defensive: it’s so big that Elon himself spoke on it a couple times recently, claiming it was a photobomb and that she “snuck up on him” (LOL yup. She just happened to insert herself into a photo that is [centered perfectly on both Musk and Maxwell](https://i.imgur.com/Us1KnWO.jpg). Makes perfect sense.)

But have you guys noticed that Elon is particularly bothered by this specific picture? He’s gone full damage-control mode over it, and has been more thin-skinned than usual lately. Just [look at the way he melted down](https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1279245771733426177?s=21) 
the other day over a [joke tweet](https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1278923187393376257?s=21) 
that Ken Klippenstein made. He’s even going so far as to [send his 30 million followers after a journalist for bringing up his connection to Maxwell and Epstein.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1279471909906702336?s=21) How upset does one have to be to publicly tell his followers to report people criticizing him? For a billionaire who publicly called some random guy a pedophile and won the following defamation suit, Elon Musk seems a little overly upset about a photo of himself standing next to known underage sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate. 

And every time, he and his fans make the same argument that the picture itself is meaningless: it’s just one picture, and plenty of rich people are friends and attend these parties. And you know what? They’re right that just one picture means nothing without context. So I decided to dig deeper, and I found out some fun facts about our buddy Elon...

Epstein had been known to fraternize with Silicon Valley moguls. In 2012, Epstein and his entourage were arranged a [private tour of Elon Musk's SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California.](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-dated-kimbal-musk-brother-of-tesla-founder-elon-musk-2020-1)

Just to make this extra clear: Epstein was convicted for raping a minor in 2008 and was given a private tour of SpaceX in 2012. And those convictions alone don’t show the full scale of the stuff Epstein had done by then. Per Wikipedia, [he was convicted of only these two crimes as part of a plea deal; federal officials had identified 36 girls, some as young as 14 years old, whom Epstein had allegedly sexually abused.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein)

Epstein was in regular contact with Elon's brother Kimbal Musk and in 2011, [Epstein set him up with a woman in his entourage](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-dated-kimbal-musk-brother-of-tesla-founder-elon-musk-2020-1) Kimbal ended up dating her for a year. (I’m sure this was completely legal btw, Epstein would never include minors or rape/trafficking victims in his entourage...) The woman, who had previously dated Epstein, lived in an apartment building where he was known to house certain women. So even if she was legal, this woman who dated Musk’s brother for a year must have had some connection and knowledge of Epstein’s continuing activities. 

Later that same year, Elon [attended an elite private dinner with Jeffrey Epstein, less than 2 years after he served a prison sentence for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl.](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-dinner-bezos-elon-musk-bill-gates-report-2011-2019-9) Oh look, [more photobombs](https://twitter.com/jcoviedo6/status/1279518040405823488?s=21)!!!

Elon is naturally denying this. Earlier this week, he came out and felt the need to repeat it yet again. Now he claims Epstein never toured SpaceX. He claims he refused to have anything to do with Epstein, and said he was “obviously a creep” when he first met him. But then why did Elon go to a private dinner with this creep afterwards in 2011?

This so far is just the stuff we know on the surface that was publicly published and made available for everyone to know. As was the case with many other famous people, Epstein had a ton more dirt on Elon behind the scenes. 

In August 2018, New York Times columnist James B. Stewart met with Epstein, agreeing that he wouldn’t reveal Epstein as the source of any quotes from the conversation.

After Epstein was murdered, The New York Times published this [detailed account](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html) of the 90-minute-long meeting — and it had a lot to do with Elon Musk. Jeffrey Epstein claimed to be both a financial adviser and a crisis manager for Tesla and Elon. 

>Mr. Epstein avoided specifics about his work for Tesla. He told me that he had good reason to be cryptic: Once it became public that he was advising the company, he’d have to stop doing so, because he was “radioactive.” He predicted that everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend.

Epstein [told the reporter](https://futurism.com/the-byte/jeffrey-epstein-advised-tesla-elon-musk) that he suspected Tesla and Musk would deny speaking to him, and as he predicted, Musk spokesperson Keely Sulprizio told Stewart that “it is incorrect to say that Epstein ever advised Elon on anything”. 

I also found this funny little excerpt in that NYT article: “Mr. Epstein then meandered into a discussion of other prominent names in technology circles. He said people in Silicon Valley had a reputation for being geeky workaholics, but that was far from the truth: They were hedonistic and regular users of recreational drugs. He said he’d witnessed prominent tech figures taking drugs and arranging for sex.” LOL. Sound familiar anyone??? 😂

Going back to the article: crazily enough, the New York Times had exclusive access to a full interview of Epstein that was released directly following his death, and the overwhelming majority of this interview ended up being about his connections advising Tesla and Elon Musk. Seriously, read the full article I linked here. Wow. Holy shit.

But hey, maybe Elon Musk is just a soulless CEO who doesn’t mind networking with a child rapist and trafficker if it makes him money. After all, we don’t really have any indication that Elon sexualizes infantilism or anything right? Those hilarious catgirl memes he spams are wholesome 100 and not indicative in any way of his preferences in women!!! Anyways, [here’s a completely unrelated picture of him and his current wife. ](https://i.imgur.com/eGRkp5u.jpg)

On a more serious note, we shouldn’t be that surprised by his connections to Epstein, given the Musk family history. After all, Elon Musk’s dad recently had a baby with his daughter. (Yes, you read that right. He impregnated his daughter and had a child with her.) And it’s a well-known fact that [pedophilia runs in families](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469797/), and in fact [correlates more strongly with one’s genes than one’s family environment](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/news/sex-offending-genes-more-important-than-family-environment)

All of the denials of Elon’s involvement with Epstein are extremely shaky. Elon himself denied it, but of course he did. The last couple of days, he felt the strong urge to come out and publicly diminish his involvement with Epstein. Oh, and how could I forget his ex wife Talulah Riley, who [“wanted to respond publicly with @elonmusk’s permission”](https://twitter.com/talulahriley/status/1279506448045805569?s=21). 

“See, Elon said he wasn’t involved with the child rapist! Lord Musk must be speaking to truth!!! You think someone would do that, just go on the Internet and spread lies??” No shit all of the PR statements and Elon-approved accounts of those events are going to paint Elon as an angel, completely non-complicit and non-involved in Epstein’s operations. 

At the end of the day, there’s no concrete evidence yet that 100% proves that Elon was directly complicit with Epstein’s activities. But there’s a shit ton of evidence that shows he was heavily involved with Epstein. And there sure as hell is ZERO evidence that he WASN’T connected to Epstein. Interpret this post as you will. I’ll update it more as more information comes out.

"360","2020-11-28","Hydrogen, and why Musk is against it.","Hydrogen, is in many respects, vastly superior to Li ion batteries when it comes to energy storage for vehicles.
 
But whenever someone asks Musk about it he quickly laughs at it. 

But this is the same man who wants to replace trains and subways with his own insanely inneficient projects. 

Musk knows that the more viable that hydrogen looks to politicians who will fund it, the more it will take away from his bottom line. 

Electric cars are extremely easy to engineer compared to an hydrogen car, and the network is also much easier. All you need to do is make stations that deliver electric energy, which is easy since we already have the infrastructure for that all down. 

But for Musk to look like an innovator with hydrogen he would need to fund the entire infrastructure of hydrogen. Which would never be viable for him. 

Hydrogen isn't clean yet. Like lithium, you will need to wait until the entire production is clean for it to be 0 emissions. But here's the rundown on why hydrogen would be beneficial

1. Recharging times similar to conventional fossile fuel vehicles. 

2. Much, much better energy per weight. Which means lighter vehicles, which is in itself greener, but especially relevant in long range vehicles. Long range electric cars are some of the least environmentally friendly vehicles out there. If you want a long range vehicle hydrogen will always be cleaner than lithium ion batteries. And this difference will intensify with trucks. The tesla semi truck is a joke. It will conceide huge payload capacity to transport it's massive battery. My prediction is that hydrogen will become the standard for trucks even if it doesn't for regular cars.

3. The end goal would be greener than lithium batteries. Whilst right now hydrogen is not particularly green. In the future with an actual 0 emissions energy production and new methods of getting hydrogen that are being produced, it will be cleaner than the mess that is lithium mining and all the ethical issues it involves.

4. No battery degradation. A 20 year old fossile fuel car will do almost the same mpg as a brand new version of the same model. This isn't the case with battery cars which will lose their capacity over many cycles and will eventually need replacement. Replacement is costly and not exactly environmentally friendly. Just like a fossile fuel car, an hydrogen fuel cell car will do the same distance with a brand new car as it does with an old one.

I think lithium ion battery cars will stay, even with a full hydrogen infrastructure, they will still probably be cheaper to run than hydrogen (although that might change if you add the cost of battery replacement every 8 years or so.), but as city cars that you can charge at home, they will always have an appeal.

TL;DR Musk dismisses and opposes Hydrogen because he knows that he can get the same or more governmental handouts while investing less money in the horse he backed for this race."

Edit: going into this thread, I held the view that ""engineer"" is a title given with obtaining a degree in engineering. I will admit I did not consider that one might be employed as an engineer without being a qualified engineer. In fact, in my country, that isn't quite legal. I'd like to iterate that, in the face of being accused of gatekeeping and elitism, I was merely trying to defend the integrity of my degree. I have seen far too many unqualified people calling themselves engineers without any theoretical or practical knowledge/training. However in light of some of your arguments, I will accept that I was wrong. I apologise if I've offended anyone. I will no longer be reading or replying to comments in this thread as I have accepted I was wrong and will try to be more open to the points some of you've raised.

This gives you an interesting insight into the mind of this narcissistic man. When it’s not SpaceX, when it’s not him, when it’s not about him, he simply will stay quiet. 

Musk fanboys need to learn this. SpaceX is just a glorified truck driver for NASA. NASA does the big stuff. SpaceX does the small stuff. Starship isn’t getting to Mars. But even if it does reach miraculously, one thing won’t change. Musk’s narcissism."

"904","2021-12-18","Elon Musk and the Emerald Mine","So, the geniuses over at r/elonmusk want to believe that Elon Musk grew up poor. A big point of contention is whether Elon's father, Errol Musk, owned an emerald mine. Here's Elon denying that claim:

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1211054942192119808](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1211054942192119808)

The Elon Cult believes that the emerald mine story stems from solely from this 2018 article, which they dismiss as being a one-off:

[https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2)

However, I was able to quickly track down this article from 2012, which also mention's Errol's emerald mine:

[https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a16681/elon-musk-interview-1212/](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a16681/elon-musk-interview-1212/)

Here's where things get really interesting. I found this Forbes interview with Elon in 2014, in which he brings up his father's emerald mine. But the article has been scrubbed from Forbes website, so I had to find it on the wayback machine:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20140802011449/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2014/07/28/elon-musk-tells-me-his-secret-of-success-hint-it-aint-about-the-money/](https://web.archive.org/web/20140802011449/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2014/07/28/elon-musk-tells-me-his-secret-of-success-hint-it-aint-about-the-money/)

The same interview was posted to AskMen. You can see the intro to that interview here:

[https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/right-stuff/elon-musk-interview.html](https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/right-stuff/elon-musk-interview.html)

The other pages of the interview seem to have been scrubbed, but the internet is forever, and the wayback machine captured the posted interview several times, so here's the relevant part of the full interview:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20210410140339/https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/right-stuff/elon-musk-interview-3.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410140339/https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/right-stuff/elon-musk-interview-3.html)

>EM: I’ve been in physical danger before. The funny thing is I’ve not actually been that nervous. In South Africa when I was growing up, my father had a private plane we’d fly in incredibly dangerous weather and barely make it back. This is going to sound slightly crazy, but my father also had a share in an emerald mine in Zambia. I was 15 and really wanted to go with him but didn’t realize how dangerous it was. I couldn’t find my passport so I ended up grabbing my brother’s -- which turned out to be six months overdue! So we had this plane load of contraband and an overdue passport from another person. There were AK-47s all over the place and I’m thinking, “Man, this could really go bad.” I also almost died of malaria in 2001 -- I was within a day and a half of being unrecoverable.

So, either this reporter either wrote and posted a fake Elon Musk interview...or he interviewed Elon and later Elon convinced these publications to remove the articles.

Either way, you now have some links to show people when they claim, ""Elon Musk is self-made and his dad never owned an emerald mine.""

Legal disclaimer: I am curious as to why this interview was pulled from Forbes and partially pulled from Ask Men, so I'm not making any claims as to whether or not it is 100% factual. I'm just pointing out that these publications published this alleged interview with Elon Musk in which he brings up his father's emerald mine.

Note: Here's a bit more about the person who conducted the interview. He seems like a legit journalist.

(C’mon, we all have noticed that those truckers are not fighting for the freedom and Elon Musk pretends to be anti-mandate but deep down he is just salty about his factory being shut down during the heart of pandemic. He distributed the growth of Corona death by refusing to close the factory.)

-Ah, yes, “Corona panic is dumb. “He said Corona death rate is exaggerated. 

-He presumably wanted to get the Tesla whistleblower dead by lying about him and illustrating him as a terrorist. The whistleblower lost the lawsuit against Tesla he seems a bit of lunatic, but the important thing is he was never a terrorist nor a shooter, this was proven by SWAT police. Musk turned him in, so SWAT squad had to come in. 

-He fired his long served secretary Mary just because she demanded a bit more salary. 

-Pedo tweet that showed his impulsive rage against the Cave explorer who arranged everything for the rescue just because he was mocked by him for his glorified submarine. If Elon Musk really wanted to help the Thai kids, then he would have kept it low till the rescue was over. He just raged out loud so hard that all the media was drawn to the tweet. 

Despite all this his idiocy and man child behaviour I thought he is a good person. 

And this week, he uploads numerous anti vaccine narrative and memes on twitter made me notice his true color. 

Elon Musk doesn’t give a fuck about any of you guys. He thinks Corona is dumb fuck and everybody died of Corona is well deserved. He is Corona skeptic and he only cares about himself and his stupid overpromised goals so that he can feel like he is the king of the world. 

This attention whore deserves to be bullied back in High School if the story isn’t made up.

(Only if it is true, because bullying is an awful thing, the implement is all is made up to gain sympathy from the public. Because he wants to control the public views on him as he is “the good Savior”.)"

He doesn't even remember what he was doing at certain positions, it is insane to give so much sauce to a senile idiot like that. 

I think this was posted before, but it definitely deserves to be featured in more posts. This is how he treats experts. It's no wonder why he thinks the majority of common people that are not some to him super useful scientists are trash and will go to hell...

"601","2022-07-17","Twitter's filing in Delaware court shows Musk was actively sabotaging Twitter's business and the acquisition deal","[The filing](https://www.wlrk.com/docs/76660099_Final-Verified-Complaint.pdf) is a profile of Musk's MO: he's impulsive, petulant, and bullying; he reneges on his word constantly; and uses his money & power to get what he wants. Unfortunately for him, [Bret Taylor](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1546965769983889409) and Twitter's lawyers have an airtight contract which Musk (typically) signed back in April without much thought. And despite repeated, flagrant violations of the agreement by Musk over the next 3 months, Twitter has abided by it. So Elon is now up shit creek without a baguette.

Highlights:

* *""On April 25, 2022, Musk\[\] agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, for a total of about $44 billion. That price, presented by Musk on a take-it-or-leave-it basis in an unsolicited public offer, represented a 38% premium over Twitter’s unaffected share price. The other terms Musk offered and agreed to were, as he touted, “seller friendly.” There is no financing contingency and no diligence condition. The deal is backed by airtight debt and equity commitments. Musk has personally committed $33.5 billion.""* (Sections 3, 4) In other words, he threw money at Twitter, and was so confident of winning that he signed the deal without doing any due diligence and basically guaranteeing the financing himself.

&#x200B;

* *""Musk’s exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy. One of the chief reasons Musk cited\[\] for wanting to buy Twitter was to rid it of the “\[c\]rypto spam” he viewed as a “major blight on the user experience.” But when the market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding “verification” that spam was not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need to conduct “diligence” he had expressly forsworn.""* (Section 7) Due diligence is a process you do before entering into a contract not after. If only the golden boy knew that.

&#x200B;

* *""Musk’s strategy is also a model of bad faith. While pretending to exercise the narrow right he has under the merger agreement\[\], Musk has been working furiously — albeit fruitlessly — to try to show that the company he promised to buy and not disparage has made material misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors. He has also asserted, falsely, that consummation of the merger depends on the results of his fishing expedition and his ability to secure debt financing.""* (Section 8) He's been throwing spaghetti at the wall trying to get out of the deal. And in the meantime he's been making public tweets (the irony!) about how bad the company is.

&#x200B;

* *""Twitter has abided by its covenants\[\]. Musk, by contrast, has been acting against this deal since the market started turning, and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process. He has purported to put the deal on “hold” pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions, breached his financing efforts obligations in the process, violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status, violated his non-disparagement obligation, misused confidential information, and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition.""* (Section 10) Read: Musk has broken the contract's rules so many times himself, that he has no leg to stand on when asking for the deal to be cancelled because of anything Twitter did.

&#x200B;

* *""On May 13\[\], Twitter explained\[\] that its spam estimation process entails daily sampling for a total set of approximately 9,000 accounts per quarter that are manually reviewed. Later that day, Musk Tweeted publicly a misrepresentation that Twitter’s sample size for spam estimates was just 100. The next day, he boasted publicly that he had violated his non- disclosure obligations.""* (Section 74-76) Flagrant and boastful disregard for the contract and his NDA obligations.

&#x200B;

* *""On May 20, 2022, Musk’s team sent a request for Twitter’s “firehose” data — which is essentially a live-feed of data concerning activity\[\] associated with the public accounts on Twitter’s platform. Again, no explanation was offered for how this request furthered a “reasonable business purpose""\[\], as required by Section 6.4.\[\] \[Musk\] responded with increasingly invasive and unreasonable requests. And rather than use “reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the respective business of \[Twitter\], \[Musk\] repeatedly demanded immediate responses to their access requests. The scope of the requests and the deadlines defendants imposed on their satisfaction were unreasonable, disruptive to the business, and far outside the bounds of Section 6.4. Twitter nonetheless continued to work with Musk to try to respond to the requests.""* (Sections 84-88)

&#x200B;

* *""After all, Musk had said he would do one of three things with Twitter: sit on its board, buy it, or build a competitor. He had already accepted and then rejected the first option, and was plotting a pretextual escape from the second. Musk’s third option — building a competitor to Twitter — remained. Still, Twitter again responded constructively and reiterated its commitment to work with Musk’s team to provide reasonable access to requested information.""* (Section 89)

&#x200B;

* *""Steadfast in its commitment to consummate the merger, Twitter continued to try to get Musk’s team what it demanded while safeguarding its customers’ data and harboring very real concerns about how Musk might use the data if he succeeded in escaping the deal. On or about June 9, 2022, Musk’s counsel indicated that granting access to 30 days’ worth of historical firehose data would satisfy Musk’s request for the firehose data. So, on June 15, the company gave Musk’s team secure access to that raw data — about 49 tebibytes’ worth (Note: that's \~53.87 terabytes). It did so even though the merger agreement did not require the sharing of this information.* (Sections 91-93)

&#x200B;

* *""On June 29, 2022, Musk complained through counsel that Twitter purportedly had “placed an artificial cap on the number of searches” Musk’s experts could run on the firehose data\[\]. Twitter explained that it had placed “no artificial throttling of rate limits.” In follow-up correspondence, it became clear that the “limit” Musk had bumped up against was not the result of throttling but a default 100,000-per-month limit on the number of queries that could be conducted. With his undisclosed team of data reviewers working behind the scenes, Musk had hit that limit within about two weeks. Twitter immediately agreed to, and did, raise the monthly search query limit one hundred-fold, to 10 million — more than 100 times what most paying Twitter customers would get.""* (Sections 98-100)

&#x200B;

* *""In a June 30 conversation with Segal (Twitter CFO), Musk acknowledged he had not read the detailed summary of Twitter’s sampling process provided back in May. Once again, Segal offered to spend time with Musk and review the detailed summary of Twitter’s sampling process as the Twitter team had done with Musk’s advisors. That meeting never occurred despite multiple attempts by Twitter.""* (Section 101)

&#x200B;

* *""Musk has unreasonably withheld consent to two employee retention programs designed to keep selected top talent during a period of intense uncertainty generated in large part by Musk’s erratic conduct and public disparagement of the company and its personnel.\[\] Musk initially failed to respond at all to the June 20 consent request. (It would soon become clear that he had fired Swan.) After a follow-up request for consent, Musk’s counsel stated tersely that “Elon is not supportive of this program and has declined to grant consent for it.” Twitter offered to arrange a meeting between Musk and Lane Fox to explain the importance and utility of the proposed programs. Musk’s counsel repeated that Musk “doesn’t believe a retention program is warranted in the current environment,” and said Musk was unwilling to consider the advice of compensation consultants.""* (Sections 116-120)

I hope the Delaware Chancery Court does the right thing and makes Elon pay the $44B. Sadly, I suspect he will get away for the same reason rich people have always gotten away with doing shit like this: corruption, the power of money, and the willingness to destroy something valuable to the public (Twitter in this case) if he doesn't get his way.

"421","2022-10-22","Elon Musk has been a disaster for science communication, and his downfall will be one of the best things to happen to it.","As somebody with a scientific degree, one of the big reasons why I personally dislike Elon Musk is the damage that he's done to the communication of scientific subjects to the public, especially (but not exclusively) when it comes to space exploration. Between his massive wealth, the source of his wealth in the tech industry, and his personal interests, he is treated as a leading public intellectual who's on the frontier of cutting-edge scientific discoveries, and so the media, for the longest time, easily glossed over statements of his where, if you had any serious knowledge of the subject, you could figure pretty quickly that he had no clue what he was talking about.

This has been a growing problem with science communicators and public intellectuals in the West, especially after Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould died. For every one like PZ Myers, Yvette d'Entremont, Randall Munroe, and Ben Goldacre who generally know their stuff, you get a dozen people like Steven Pinker, Michio Kaku, Elise Andrew, and Jared Diamond who trade on their charisma and credibility in one field to make statements in others that don't hold up to scrutiny, or worse, outright hacks like Malcolm Gladwell and Jordan Peterson who are seen as credible mainly because they look, write, and sound like how the average person imagines a smart person to be like, even if their ideas are empty.

I think Musk is one of the hacks. I think a lot of you guys here would agree with me in that assessment. However, he has one thing that the other hacks I mentioned don't: money. Lots and lots of money that he likes to throw around on projects that he fancies. He can, with some degree of credibility to the lay person, say that he is actually pushing forward into bold new frontiers of science, from his bread-and-butter of electric cars (Tesla) to space exploration/exploitation (SpaceX and Starlink) to cybernetics (Neuralink) to artificial intelligence (OpenAI) to new forms of rail travel (the hyperloop), because he is actually funding them, or at least claiming to.

Never mind how many of his projects have turned into vaporware. Never mind Neuralink's ethical problems involving their experiments on monkeys that went horribly wrong, or Starlink's inefficiency compared to other forms of internet access. For the average person in the West, Musk is probably *the* face of science communication, and so his interests tend to dominate mainstream scientific discussion.

I can't wait for the day when every tech and science writer in this country doesn't feel the need to hang on his every word."

Back in October 2020, Elon Musk announced that Tesla completely dissolved its PR department. That is also around the time that Reddit *really* started to change its opinion on Elon Musk.

We all secretly know he was paying people to get positive articles upvoted on Reddit. If you haven't tried it out for yourself, do it. It's incredibly easy to buy upvotes to give posts an early boost so they hit the trending. I'm not going to tell people how to do it, because Reddit might randomly ban my account. Once enough positive posts trend in defaults, others will see those articles upvoted based on their title, and will post their own. The Reddit hivemind is a strong beast. 

There has to be someone out there who was randomly fired and is willing to spill the beans. This is a great forum to do it."

"250","2022-11-23","""I was an intern at SpaceX years ago, back it when it was a much smaller company — after Elon got hair plugs, but before his cult of personality was in full swing. I have some insight to offer here.""","""Back when I was at SpaceX, Elon was basically a child king. He was an important figurehead who provided the company with the money, power, and PR, but he didn’t have the knowledge or (frankly) maturity to handle day-to-day decision making and everyone knew that. He was surrounded by people whose job was, essentially, to manipulate him into making good decisions.

Managing Elon was a huge part of the company culture. Even I, as a lowly intern, would hear people talking about it openly in meetings. People knew how to present ideas in a way that would resonate with him, they knew how to creatively reinterpret (or ignore) his many insane demands, and they even knew how to “stage manage” parts of the physical office space so that it would appeal to Elon.

The funniest example of “stage management” I can remember is this dude on the IT security team. He had a script running in a terminal on one of his monitors that would output random garbage, Matrix-style, so that it always looked like he was doing Important Computer Things to anyone who walked by his desk. Second funniest was all the people I saw playing WoW at their desks after \~5pm, who did it in the office just to give the appearance that they were working late.

People were willing to do that at SpaceX because Elon was giving them the money (and hype) to get into outer space, a mission people cared deeply about. The company also grew with and around Elon. There were layers of management between individual employees and Elon, and those managers were experienced managers *of* Elon. Again, I cannot stress enough how much of the company culture was oriented around managing this one guy.

Twitter has neither of those things going for it. There is no company culture or internal structure around the problem of managing Elon Musk, and I think for the first time we’re seeing what happens when people actually take that man seriously and at face value. Worse, they’re doing this little experiment after this man has had decades of success at companies that dedicate significant resources to protecting themselves from him, and he’s too narcissistic to realize it. 

This post is long so I’ll leave you with my favorite Elon story. One day at work, I got an all hands email telling me that it was Elon’s birthday and there was going to be a mandatory surprise party for him in the cafeteria. Presumably Elon also got this email, but whatever. We all marched down into the cafeteria, dimmed the lights, and waited. Elon was led out by his secretary (who he hadn’t fired yet) and made a big show of being fake surprised and touched that we were there. Then they wheeled out the cake.

OK, so, I want you to imagine the biggest penis cake you’ve ever seen. Like the king of novelty sex cakes. Only it’s frosted white, and the balls have been frosted to look like fire and smoke. This was Elon’s birthday “rocket” cake.

For as long as I live, I will never forget the look on everyone’s face — in that dark room of mostly-male engineers — when he made a wish and cut into the tip. ""

"212","2022-11-30","Elon is accusing Apple of being anti-free speech in an attempt to avoid what occurred to Tumblr - and it's pathetic.","I don't think many people are actually aware of *why* porn was banned on Tumblr, aside from those who bothered to look into the matter - prior to 2018, Tumblr had a MASSIVE child exploitation content problem.

I cannot emphasize enough how many people have been arrested for having saved content from that website, and how under Verizon, that content was entirely allowed to flourish unabated.

Up until 2018, in which Apple hung the guillotine over their necks and effectively issued an ultimatum, in which Tumblr would need to ban certain types of content as it had demonstrated it could not moderate it. (Why do you think Reddit is on the app store and still has porn? It's their aggressive moderation that allows for it.)

For the past several months, I have been wondering when Twitter would face similar issues, because of how bad the situation was getting out of control with child exploitation material on their website.

And, since Twitter has GUTTED their moderation team for a giant, giant website, I'm sure Apple is asking the same questions.

This is why (imo) Elon is so aggressively accusing Apple of being anti-free speech. It's to spin the narrative that they're doing something wrong, or out of character - when they're most likely threatening to repeat what happened with Tumblr for the same issues - a complete disregard for moderation that prevents child exploitation from flourishing online. Because if the narrative of child exploitation were to reign supreme, Twitter would lose all of advertisers that it's still clinging to."

But his swastika-star of David abomination with a garbled “I love everyone” message isn’t incitement to violence and would not be considered so in any court of law (which are quite strict on the definition in the US). In fact I’d actually say it was far less so than his “death con 3” tweet. 

So why did Elon say that? Because he needed a serious and official-sounding excuse to ban him for it. He can’t have public figures openly posting swastikas on his platform, it’s just terrible optics for users and advertisers. But if he just admitted that, he’d be admitting that he’s actually just moderating content in the same (sensible) way as the previous team. He’s really dug himself into quite an impressive hole here, and a lot of his beloved right-wing fans are already questioning him."

His ventures will not deliver what he was promising. Furthermore some of his friends and people he likes are calling him out. More and more people are abandoning him, so what is left to do? 

Elon's last stupid idea is to kill himself and make it look like someone killed him. People will believe that there was some kind of conspiracy against him. He already prepared this with his tweets, out of nowhere he claims that he could be assassinated, then he claims that he is not suicidal. 

Some will say that he is just creating drama to distract from other problems, which could be true. But I think he is giving up and that's his way to becoming an eternal hero for his followers. This is what he wants."

"654","2023-01-07","How do people still respect Elon?","I am really curious how people think this person is anything but a con man. Let's look at his history:

**Company:**

* **X.com:** which turned into PayPal through a merger with Peter Thiel company and Peter had to take over to make it a viable company until eBay bought it out and that’s where Elon got his first payday.
* **Tesla**: He used his PayPal money to join the existing founders and eventually kicked them out and acted like he was the brains behind the entire premise. Then when he was running it, he took advantage of government loans to secure its future (both direct loans, Carbon Credits, and EV tax credits), and the vast majority of early funding was from Mercedes Benz, Toyota, and Panasonic to this day still runs the majority of their battery lines
* **SolarCity**: He bought his cousins business out of the dumps and then promised things like solar      panel shingles which still have not come to mainstream, so much so that the Panasonic in their Buffalo factory had to freeze production for a while based on demand
* **SpaceX**: His originally plan was to buy old Russian ICBM's until he was convinced to build its own rocket at which point Gwynne Shotwell took over as CEO and ran the company from there. Gwynne is the reason that SpaceX is where it is at.
* **OpenAI**: He had a thought about machine learning and put together people from Tesla's self-driving division but had to pass the CEO roll to Sam Altman (Y Combinator) to run it
* **Boring Compan**y: He promised to revolutionize both transportation and tunneling. The only project that  succeeded (if you want to call it that) was the Las Vegas convention center. It turns out it is just a tunnel with people who drive Tesla's back and forth for transportation (it's like he missed the concept of subways), all other major projects have been cancelled
* **Neuralink**: A company that so far has managed to kill a bunch of monkeys with a few surviving to      demonstrate what has already been accomplished with existing technology.
* **Twitter:** Waived due diligence and bought a company for x3-4 times it's worth and then proceeded      to gut it out and ask to find a new CEO to run it.

&#x200B;

**Personal:**

* To date every one of his ex-wives/gf's have nothing too good to say about him (even Grimes came out against him)
* He refutes (even though there is ample evidence) that his dad owned a mine in South Africa that gave him starting capital
* His daughter has asked to legally change her name so she is no longer associated with him
* He got Boo'd off the stage in SF with Dave Chapelle who also was weirded out with him being on stage
* His companies all have massive legal lawsuits about working conditions, discrimination, and anti-competitive problems
* He is the only person in history to lose 200 Billion dollars in market value
* Lied about his education and how he only got an honorary degree
* He either knowingly or unknowingly lies about time lines for every product that one of his companies creates (self-driving tech, cyber truck, neuralink, Mars Mission, Moon Mission, Speed of boring, and so much more)
* He's gone completely delusional on Twitter

I'm sure the list goes on but seriously, how do people still think this con-man is a good person. This is kind of what they said about people like Bernie Madoff. He is just a really skilled con-man."

It's been clear for a while, but is impossible to ignore now, Musk bought Twitter to spread right-wing propaganda and misinformation as far and wide as Twitter's audience goes.

In all this, however, he's revealed that he's just a giant manbaby with an ego as fragile as a Twitter employee's job security. And there's nothing more effective at shattering that as making the good numbers go down and the bad numbers go up.

If you still have an active Twitter account, just **block this moron**. Every single block is a number on an ever-growing pile that makes him sad. The best thing you can do is block him and **stop using Twitter**, but I know a lot of people still think somehow Twitter will recover from this. Spoiler: *it won't*.

[Here's a link to his account](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), just click those three little dots, hit 'Block' and then confirm. What are you actually losing out on by doing this?

Musk is incredibly aggravating. But the ways in which he is aggravating are part and parcel of the fascist project. The fascists do exactly the same things!

* The promise of a return to greatness, a revival of the creative spirit;
* Veneration of one man as embodying this return to greatness. Propaganda that this one man has an implausible number of abilities;
* Intense gaslighting about this one man's actual achievements and track record.
* Rise to power, steal the money, pervert the laws if you can.
* When things don't work out due to their extreme incompetence, it's all because of <name your conspiracy theory>. Don't worry, we'll get revenge! You just have to believe harder! Send more money!

"817","2023-04-25","Musk is a more dangerous version of Rupert Murdoch and it will become more obvious as time passes. Most people just don't realize it yet. Musk will use twitter as a weapon for his own personal gain. the 2024 US elections will show this.","The buying of Twitter was a political move not an economic move. When a billionaire buys a media company(either traditional media or new media) he does it so that he can control public discourse in order to influence culture and voting patterns not for a financial return. Most media companies have low return on investment but what they do have is a enormous political influence And that is why in most countries on planet earth billionaires buy media companies: to influence elections and the average joe in order to get certain people in power for different reasons (usually corruption, to get lower taxes, to get government contracts etc). This is why Musk bought twitter too: not to make money out of it but to wield it as a weapon of political influence to enough policies and tax breaks that will favor Tesla and Spacex. It will also allow foreign governments to influence elections in the US, UK, Australia etc in return for financial incentives for Musk. The ROI on twitter will come from its political influence not from its own financials.

This is because Twitter is one of the main platforms(if not the main one its bigger than youtube and facebook in terms of political influence) on which politicians in the west communicate with their voters and thus has a huge impact on elections in the US, Uk, Australia France etc which are countries in which Musk has a vested financial interest in (especially the US).

Analyse this from three points of view: government contracts(money), Musk's own political views(culture) and dictatorships.

1. Government contracts: Musk's entire wealth and fortune has been built on government subsidies and contracts. Tesla wouldn't have gotten of the ground without US state subsidies for EVs and other state subsidies and Spacex is 100% reliant on contracts with NASA. These are Musk's ONLY two sources of wealth. What happens if a politician or party in the US would try to cut these subsidies or give NASA contracts to other more deserving companies? They would get trashed on Twitter aka probably the most impactful social media companies in the US. A bunch of trolls and doxxes and leaks could for example appear on twitter about that policies or about that political party without being verified (DNC leaks anyone?) and since Musk is running the show now these information will be free to propagate itself to tens of millions of twitter users thus influencing elections and since in the US elections are once every two years this will put enormous pressure on politicians not to mess with Musk which means Musk will have access to tax payer funds with a lot less opposition and scrutiny. This corrupt strategy is very very common in a lot of countries. This also incentivises politicians to get on Musk's good side and push legislation in favour of Musk which again will give Musk an enormous leverage without even having to spend lobbying money to get what he wants. Twitter is the most powerful lobby for Musk's interests.
2. Culture. Since buying Twitter Musk has allied himself with only one side of the culture movement: the alt right and the more extremist conservatives. His constant friendly contacts only with the likes of catturd, endwokeness, ian miles cheong etc as well the unbanning of multiple alt right leaders shows one thing only: that he is 100% on the side of the alt right. given his wealth and his ownership of twitter and given the fact that the alt right and extremist conservatives have mostly been banned from Facebook and YouTube this makes Musk the most powerful person in the altright movement. Also given the fact that the alt right is encompasses most of the young conservatives and that the young conservatives mostly use social media this gives Musk an enormous influence in the republican party atm. Given twitter's reach I would say Musk is the second most powerful man in the republican party right now behind Rupert Murdoch himself and the most important when it comes to young conservatives votes. The impact on US and UK elections will be huge. Back in the 2016 US presidential elections in the US alt right twitter users and political operatives were some of the most influential and impactful on the Trump side. Take for example Rick Vaughn (now in prison for election manipulations). A study showed that he had a bigger reach and impact than most mainstream news organizations. Twitter banned him but musk will certainly not ban people like him. Fake news peddlers and hardcore alt right political activists (including here on reddit remember thedonald?) are some of the main people that made sure Donald Trump became president. Under Musk twitter will not ban the Ricky Gervaises anymore thus allowing alt right candidates to take over countries such as the US, the Uk and Australia. As long as they continue to funnel money into Musks' companies and give him tax breaks Musk will gladly let a lot of countries be take over by alt right trolls.
3. Foreign governments. Musk has vested interests in a lot of dictatorships mainly China. Given twitter's impact on US elections and politics this gives Musk huge leverage when negotiating with dictatorships. He can for example promise a dictatorship such as China that they will be allowed to influence politicians in the US and UK if Musk is allowed to operate in China. It can also promise them that he can put a good word for them mainly in Republican circles in exchange for contracts in those countries. Keep in mind Musk has a huge sway and power over the republican party in the US and the conservative parties in the UK, Australia and canada given the fact theat twitter is now the only social media platforms that allows the alt right and conservative extremists to openly operate on it without repercussions. It's very very very dangerous for countries for countries such as the US, UK, Canada, Australia etc to have the main political socal media platform in those countries controlled by a corrupt ring wing billionaire with enormous financial interests in China and which has a vested interest in getting as many government subsides and tax exceptions as possible.

In conclusion it's extremely wrong to see Musk as a goofy tech dude interested in rockets who made a stupid move by buying twitter due to his ego. He is a highly calculated alt right political operative with vested interested in dictatorships and with getting as many tax breaks and exceptions and possible and he will use twitter as a weapon to get what he wants. I 100% expect Musk to be a feature at republican and conservative conventions in the next couple of years. The mask hasn't fully slipped yet but all of the signs are there."

Twitter has long been regarded as the virtual town square of the world. It played a significant role in my country by exposing government propaganda and serving as an alternative news source for those skeptical of government-funded mainstream media. Fact-checkers and open-source intelligence experts have actively shared their perspectives to counter these biased narratives.

However, I feel that the recent acquisition of Twitter by Elon has undermined the platform. He has taken to promoting politically biased posts and accounts on the main home feed, while cryptically propagating these narratives through his own tweets.
Since taking over Twitter, he has actively sabotaged the platform's functionality, seemingly for his own amusement, without considering the impact on the Twitter ecosystem. 
His first move was to dismiss more than half of the employees responsible for running the platform. And then he alienated advertisers through the dramas that followed of labels, badges, blue checks, and other such amateurish moves.

As of today, he has imposed limitations on unverified accounts, which constitute the majority of Twitter users, by restricting them to 800 tweets. A mere scroll and you're locked for the day. These changes have greatly compromised Twitter's utility and effectiveness.

It's evident that he's running Twitter to the ground deliberately for god knows why. We all can only speculate."

That's Elon. He got outdone and out maneuvered by Zuckerbot. Elon is literally such a douche he had the collective American population rooting for Meta and Zuck. Like, damn, lol. 

Now he gets the needed check on all this savior complex ""Twitter is the most important tool, saving human civilization"" nonsense talk he's convinced himself of. He will NEVER get that 44 billion back. Never. Twitter's will continue to drop until it reaches a state of neglible existence like MySpace or most other tools created around Twitter's inception.

I even logged on my alternate account, which I haven't used in months, and my for you page was littered with these far right posts. This is something that I have noticed for a while, but would like to learn more about. In the past few days I have seen:

A poll with 65k votes ""Would you rather your child be in the KKK or be LGBTQ?"" ... 75% voted KKK - which is terrifying.

A post asking for segregated pools so white people don't have to deal with the ""residue"" from black people - with tens of thousands of likes

Posts that LGBT people need to be jailed

Elon himself agreeing that only parents should be able to vote

\- This is just the beginning of it. I'm sure I'm not the only one. It's absolutely insane, and honestly scary to know how many of these people exist in the United States.

But my real question is why? Does elon boost these posts into peoples for you page because they align with his political views? If anyone could provide any information about all of this, or share your experiences with something similar, it'd be appreciated. Thanks for reading."

August 6: Elon tweets about lifting a 45 lb kettlebell to prepare for the fight.  Zuckerburg responds to Elon's tweet on Threads, saying he's ready that day. Zuckerburg says he suggested August 26th. 

August 7: Elon says he's getting an MRI of his neck and upper back, and it ""may require surgery before the fight can happen"".

August 11: Elon tweets about having the fight in Rome. DogeDesigner asks about the MRI, and Elon says there is a problem with his right shoulder blade rubbing against his ribs, which ""requires minor surgery"", and ""recovery will only take a few months"".

So.....what do you think happened with that shoulder surgery? Do you think his shoulder is still rubbing against his ribs? That sounds painful. Do you think he's up for that Zuckerburg fight now?

People say you can't pick your followers. You absolutely can. If someone is constantly retweeted and applauded by bigots, antisemites and *self-described* white supremacists, they are an ally of those people whether they are too embarrassed to admit it or not.

I know the whole ""I'm leaving"" speech is tired and unnecessary, but for me it's simply true. I've deleted my Twitter today (and for many more reasons than this alone). As far as I'm concerned, remaining on there amounts to supporting the hatred and division that ultimately lines his pockets. "

Basically they're sueing the government about the license plates.

Swedish Transport Administration will only send new license plates via PostNord, which is similar to UPS. PostNord won't deliver anything that's being sent to Tesla, as a sympathy measure for the strike. The reason for this particular portal service is due to an agreement (basically they get a discount for using only them, and now it's a signed agreement) 

Tesla want to be able to personally pick up any items themselves instead, i.e not have things mailed to them at all, they prefer sending workers to drive across the country to pick stuff up.


The Swedish law is regulated that you get your licence plate *sent*. I don't see how the Swedish government is doing anything wrong by sending them using the most well established and well known postal service in the Nordics, just because they happen to have a strike towards Tesla. That's Tesla's fault, not the Swedish government. The Swedish government has done absolutely nothing here to cause this by signing with PostNord as an exclusive service, and it was clearly never an intention to do it in order to harm Tesla. That deal was signed *years* ago. Tesla are expressing themselves narcissistic and petty.

Not sure why the TG team would end up simply leaving a copy of the script conveniently so his engineer delivery boy could have the time to proof read it probably while ordering and enjoying coffee and a bag of deez nuts. 

Meat riders in the comments going how dear lord Elmo is gut wrenched and tearing up due to the memory. But I really like watching Elmo clips to read his physical tells while lying. And the direct look in your eyes as he finishes his bs followed by a quick avert is the tell here. Any thoughts? Any other of his tells anyone has caught on?

**"" Tesla Cybertruck’s race against a Porsche 911 was apparently an 1/8-mile run**

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that the race was a quarter mile, but a satellite view of the drag strip tells a different story.""**

 Have you seen the rather impressive quarter-mile [race between the new Tesla Cybertruck and a Porsche 911](https://uk.motor1.com/news/698799/tesla-cybertruck-porsche-911-drag-race/)? It was one of the coolest pieces of last week’s Tesla Cybertruck launch, especially when the camera cut to the shot of the Cybertruck towing an identically spec'd 911 in a trailer behind it as it crossed the finish line with the first 911 hot on its tail.

But as it turns out, the race—if its entirety was shown—was filmed over a much shorter eighth-mile distance. And with the Porsche creeping up on the Cybertruck’s tail as it crossed the finish line, the outcome of a race held over a full quarter-mile may not have been the same. 

 One eagle-eyed [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/189g2l7/cybertruck_racing_the_porsche_911_was_only_a_18/) happened to notice that the race was held at the now-closed Sacramento Raceway. When comparing the stills from Tesla’s footage, it can be seen that the Cybertruck and Porsche were set up to race across the first set of thick lines painted on the track, which are placed at the eighth-mile marker alongside the grandstands. (Those[ are not present at the quarter-mile markings on the track](https://www.google.com/maps/place/5305+Excelsior+Rd,+Sacramento,+CA+95827/@38.5258039,-121.2922876,242a,35y,39.48t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x809ac259b497f193:0x65c12a3878c1381!8m2!3d38.5277248!4d-121.2952441!16s%2Fg%2F11bw4md0gh?entry=ttu).) Yet during the press conference, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk was adamant that it was a proper quarter-mile drag. ...

I hope you all find this information useful in clearly illustrating that Elon is full of shit and the simple fact that saying he has an engineering background is not only dishonest but potentially dangerous.  Happy Holidays!  


 

>He is a engineer himself

He is very much not an Engineer. He has a BA in physics and a BS in economics. While he was accepted into a material science PHD program he dropped out in 1995. This was trivially easy to look up from his wiki page [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon\_Musk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)

Engineers are held to extremely rigorous standards in the US and not only need to have an engineering specific education, but also pass two exams and complete years of on the job training in order to call themselves professional engineers. While these standards vary from state to state in the US you can find the general guidelines here:  
[https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/what-pe](https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/what-pe)

These standards exist because folks not knowing what the fuck they are doing calling themselves engineers has literally killed people. You can check out the engineering accidents related to just bridges here:

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bridge\_disasters\_caused\_by\_engineering\_error](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bridge_disasters_caused_by_engineering_error)

Law students must pass the bar to be lawyers. You can't call yourself a doctor without going to med school and Engineers put in the work to be engineers

Elon Musk is simply a venture capitalist with a passing understanding of basic physics (knowing what sub millimeter tolerances are isn't exactly rocket science, most 3D printing hobbyists are also familiar with that term)

Currently, ex-Twitter is going through a lot of problems because of a tweet he made.

I think his plan is to start using his mom's account to say his stupid shit and raging tirades. Let's take the recent tweet

""intelligent people know that the @Tesla recall is usually an over the air update...""

This is so clearly Musk's own words that it's not even funny. But it happens to be a tweet about Tesla. If Musk said this stupid ""this is not a recall!"" nonsense as the head of Tesla, it could get him in legal trouble if a good chunk of investors started to feel like they are being mislead into ignoring a recall problem.

But if it's his mother saying it, he can claim that it's just that his mother didn't understand something and that it was just her opinion.

So let's say that next week ""his mom"" replies 'True' to some raging twitter blue lunatic saying some racist shit about how All Italians are too fat to get into pipes fat because they keep eating mushrooms or something like that.

The blacks built America on their MF backs Elon. On. Their. Backs.

They were the first drafted to Korea and Vietnam, because, let's face it, the draft board was corrupt. Very.

He is a sex addict that dabbled in everything *see Epstein*.  Yet, his ""have more babies"" dog whistle is used by the right wing to promote FAMILY values. 

He believes in Eugenics and spreading his seed, yet he is not attractive, had a crap ton of plastic surgeries, is an addict, and is not athletic and/or in shape.  Nor is he genius IQ.

He is an illegal immigrant, but dog whistles on immigration on the daily.  Except for H1B immigration, because that benefits him.

His family is a flaming cheeto mess of incest, scammers, liars, con artists and self promoters.  Yet he is jealous and makes fun of people such as:  Zuck, Bezos, AOC, etc., who have REALLY accomplished more than anyone in his family has.

He says there are no UFOs 🛸,  but Congress says otherwise. He thinks he is the only one in the history of mankind that understands *space*.

There are several articles of him crying 😢,  every damn time, Chappelle etc, it because of his ego. Yet, anyone else that is harmed by him is infected with the *woke mind virus*.

His daughter is trans, yet he makes the world unsafe for her.

He hates Harvard because they are *liberal woke*, yet his son attends BROWN University, the most liberal haven in the world.   He NEVER mentions Brown.

He seems to stress population decline as literally the greatest issue of our time. This is interesting because the global population is increasing. Sub saharan africa is increasing almost exponentially yet Elon never brings this up? Does he not see the discrepancy in the information he is presenting?

​

Elon never goes into the specifics about what he means when he alludes to things like ""elevating beauty"" or how wokeness is the greatest issue to ever exist? What is he ***really*** trying to say?

We have a relatively big platform under the control of a dude who is affiliated with not only Russia and the Saudis (and of course supports and promotes their interests) but with the far right ans even neonazis.
He is in full and total control of the platform forcing the algorithm into an unprecedented situation that falls under ""stochastic terrorism"".

Imagine having that huge MAGA/Nazi pool.of people having 24/7/364 full blown far right propaganda and conspiracy theories, racist and hateful ideas projected into their timeliness with absolutely no filter.

Imagine having the world's richest man saying ""YOU ARE 100 RIGHT"" to every braindead cultist. These people are likely armed BTW. 


Musk is deliberately creating a very dangerous situation. And this is not even the worse part of it. He promotes people like libs of tik tok and presents them as messengers of the PURE TRUTH. People who are responsible even for school bombings and some of them racist attacks and murders.

And now picture this:

He is in pure control of the algorithm. He can crank it up big time whenever he wants. Woth a touch of a button he can multiply the propaganda and the brainwash 10x, 20x, 1000, 10000000x times. 

I'm afraid that we will soon see a rise in hate crime, violence, murders and who knows what else. And he will be partly responsible.

I look at this from the point of social sciences and to be honest I'm sometimes angry at this sub for trying to portray him as just a stupid person who will vanish in a few months because xyz thing will happen. 

It won't. He has enough wealth and power and  most importantly followers and cultists to do whatever he wants.

And the even worse part: he still gets a shitload of money from the government. I'm not being pessimistic or alarmist but there's just too much power in the hands of a lunatic."

UPDATED 2 HOURS AGO

A federal judge ordered Elon Musk to testify again in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's probe of his Twitter takeover, giving the regulator and the billionaire a week to agree on a date and location for the interview.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler's order issued on Saturday night formalized a tentative ruling she made in December siding with the regulator.

The SEC sued Musk in October to compel the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to testify as part of an investigation into his 2022 purchase of Twitter, the social media giant that he subsequently renamed X. Musk refused to attend an interview in September that was part of the probe, the SEC said.

The agency is examining whether Musk followed the law when filing the required paperwork about his purchases of Twitter stock, and whether his statements in relation to the deal were misleading.

Musk fought the SEC's bid to interview him, saying it had already done so twice, and accused the regulator of harassment.

Beeler rejected that argument. The SEC had authority to issue the subpoena, which sought relevant information, she said in the ruling.

If the SEC and Musk cannot agree on a date and time for the interview, Beeler said she will hear from both sides and decide for them.


Friction between Musk and the SEC began when the regulator sued him after he tweeted ""funding secured"" in 2018 in reference to a possible plan to take Tesla private. To settle that case, Musk agreed that a Tesla lawyer would vet his tweets about the electric vehicle maker. The SEC sued him again in 2019 for allegedly breaching that provision.

Musk has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the agreement, saying it violates his constitutional right to free speech.

In Elon’s MCU, Captain America punching Nazis is frowned upon. Wakanda is an apartheid state. Spinoffs of the X-Men include the S-Men, the 3-Men, the Y-Men, and the Cyberguys. 

​

He can hint at buying Disney or Marvel  all he wants, but it will never happen. It's nothing more than loser erotica for him and his sycophants to jerk off to as they fantasize about ""owning the libs"" 

after his disastrous Twitter purchase, I doubt many, if any big lenders would take the risk. Even if they did, there's no way Disney board/shareholders would approve. "

Wheels  falling off cars at speed. Suspensions collapsing on brand-new  vehicles. Axles breaking under acceleration. Tens of thousands of  customers told Tesla about a host of part failures on low-mileage cars.  The automaker sought to blame drivers for vehicle ‘abuse,’ but Tesla  documents show it had tracked the chronic ‘flaws’ and ‘failures’ for  years.

Shreyansh Jain was  ecstatic in March when he picked up his first electric vehicle, a  brand-new 2023 Tesla Model Y. He used a sizable chunk of family savings  to buy it with cash.

“We were over the moon!” said Jain, an electronics engineer in Cambridge, England.

His exuberance came to a  “grinding halt” one day later, with 115 miles on the odometer, Jain told  Reuters. As he drove with his wife and three-year-old daughter, he  suddenly lost steering control as he made a slow turn into their  neighborhood. The vehicle’s front-right suspension had collapsed, and  parts of the car loudly scraped the road as it came to a stop.

“They were absolutely  petrified,” Jain said of his wife and daughter. “If we were on a  70-mile-per-hour highway, and this would have happened, that would have  been catastrophic.”"

Elon Musk is against DEI. Being that he is autistic, he may have very well needed some DEI programs in order to access gainful employment. Of course, Elon Musk is against DEI because he's a racist who thinks DEI means giving non white people jobs just because of their race, but DEI includes other things like gender, disability, and sexuality. There are companies that have programs where they hire neurodivergent people, and many of the people hired through those programs are white men (mostly due to how it's harder for women and poc to get diagnoses for things like autism)."

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o81Rs-w3YMY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o81Rs-w3YMY)

1) We are not a car company but a A1/Robotaxi company, anyone who thinks otherwise should not be a Tesla investor

2) Comparing with Chinese ev's in price is pointless, EV's like all other cars are horse carriages. Tesla is planning for a future beyond just cars.

3) We are 2billion down in revenue because we were ""building up"" inventory (aka excess inventory...aka unsold cars)

4) We can use idle Tesla computers to sell distributed compute power to organizations when the car is not actively self driving, and pass a little profit of that to the owners.

The most hilarious one...

5) We have ""data"" that suggest Autonomous vehicles are safer than humans in 50% cases, its easy to get regulatory approval because the otherwise case is ""literally killing people"" 

​

Which is your favorite grift ?

Heart breaking news. /s

From the story:  


>The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from [Elon Musk](https://apnews.com/hub/elon-musk) over a settlement with securities regulators that requires him to get approval in advance of some tweets that relate to [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla/), the electric vehicle company he leads.  
>  
>  
>  
>The justices did not comment in leaving in place lower-court rulings  against Musk, who complained that the requirement amounts to “prior  restraint” on his speech in violation of the First Amendment.  
>  
>The case stems from tweets Musk posted in 2018 in which he claimed he  had secured funding to take Tesla private. The tweets caused the  company’s share price to jump and led to a temporary halt in trading.

What could have been solved cheaply, without affecting Tesla's market shares, reputation, charging infrastructure and customer service & repairs by just agreeing to sign a collective bargain agreement with the IF Metall union - has now caused unfathomable damage to the company over the whole nordic region (aswell as Germany) just because Elon Musk is personaly blocking Tesla Sweden from negotiating with the IF Metall trade union.

"200","2024-05-31","It’s obvious why Musk wants is bending down gargling and chortling HARD on Trump. He wants Trump to win to avoid going to jail (or get pardoned.)","One example of the many lawsuits Musk is trying to weasel out from:

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/judge-rejects-elon-musks-claim-that-sec-subpoena-is-abuse/

The SEC has been probing Musk's Twitter stock purchases to determine if he violated a securities law that requires disclosures within 10 days from anyone who buys more than a 5 percent stake in a company. Musk missed that deadline by 11 days, as he amassed close to a 10 percent stake, and a proposed class action lawsuit from Twitter shareholders has suggested that he intentionally missed the deadline to keep Twitter stock prices artificially low while preparing for his Twitter purchase.

As a seeming result, the firefighters' complaint alleged that Morgan Stanley ""pocketed over $1,460,000 in commissions just for executing"" the ""secret Twitter stock acquisition scheme."" And Morgan Stanley's work seemingly pleased Musk so much that he went back for financial advising on the Twitter deal, the complaint alleged, paying Morgan Stanley an ""estimated $42 million in fees.""

Messages from the banker show he was determined to keep the trading ""absofuckinglutely quiet"" to avoid the prospect that ""anyone sniff anything out.""

Because of this secrecy, Twitter ""investors suffered enormous damages"" when Musk ""belatedly disclosed his Twitter interests,"" and ""the price of Twitter’s stock predictably skyrocketed,"" the complaint said.

""Ultimately, Musk went from owning zero shares of Twitter stock as of January 28, 2022 to spending over $2.6 billion to secretly acquire over 70 million shares"" on April 4, 2022, the complaint said.

Instead of filing a timely disclosure, Musk allegedly hid his trades from the market, apparently helping him save more than $200 million on his acquisitions of Twitter shares from March 25, 2022, to April 4, 2022.

Musk's financial advisors were intent on keeping the trading secret, the complaint alleged, but at one point, Musk posted tweets that almost gave his apparent scheme away. Then, after warnings from wealth advisors, Musk posted ""misleading"" tweets suggesting that he was going to launch a Twitter competitor—allegedly to throw anyone off the trail who might have suspected that he was actually preparing to buy Twitter.

""Musk misleadingly represented to the public that he was 'giving serious thought' to 'building a new social media platform,' which helped further conceal that he was pursuing an active role at Twitter and also aided his scheme by keeping the price of Twitter securities artificially low,"" the lawsuit said.

Musk has failed to get the lawsuit tossed so far, Bloomberg reported, but has argued that it ""has no legal merit and is merely an attempt to 'harness the spectacle' around"" his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.

Discovery in each case probing Musk's stock purchases will likely continue influencing the other. And while Musk tried to diminish the SEC probe as being just about a ""days-late filing,"" Corley rejected that characterization in her court filing, pointing out that the SEC is also investigating “numerous filings in April and May 2022” and “whether Musk violated"" securities laws intended to protect shareholders from being blindsided by a company's acquisition."

"381","2024-07-16","Destiny interview with Adrian Dittman. Dittman is Elon. A breakdown.","I tried to post this to the /destiny sub but the mods removed it for some reason, so i figured i would put it here since i spent all the time to type it up. This is where i first hear of this ""Dittman"" anyway. I have never heard of Destiny before this. 

**His voice.**  


He has the same mannerism, same accent, same laugh, same stutter, same vocabulary, same lisp. This accent is identical to Elon. Claims he is German, but this is not a German accent. Because of my line of work I have spoken to many Germans (in English) and never heard any German similar to this, ever.   


**Twitter obsession and knowledge**  


Calls twitter ""x"". Promotes twitter features that no one uses. Tries to explain how things on twitter work. When he talked about ""his(dittman)"" account he slipped up and said ""An account that is that small"", then immediately corrected himself and said ""an account that is *this* small"". He misspoke because this is an alternate account and not his main. That is why he would say ""that account"".  


**Fake understanding of programming**  


Elon is widely know as a terrible programmer with little understanding of code. Although in his mind he thinks he is some genius coder. When they were talking about how JD Vance would have helped Trump with his Jan 6 ""coup"". ""Dittman"" says that Vance didn't say those words exactly (Elon is not able to read subtext, you have to specifically state anything for him to understand) so he said ""That is an if-then-else""... That doesn't make any sense in this context, but it fits with Elons limited and self-overestimated coding abilities, and something he would say to sound smart.  


**Claims to not know about politics/be a centrist but defends Trump**  


This fits with Elons modus operandi, being a fake centrist. Everything Trump does is great, but if Biden does something similar it is bad. He defends Trump constantly, while also attacking Biden. When Trump does something it is fine, someone on the other side does it, and he calls it ""hate speech"".  


**Short and useless quips**  


Every time he is losing the argument he says ""OK cool"", ""cool cool"", ""interesting"", or ""Are you sure?"". This is the exact same thing that Elon does in many of his posts, nothing of substance and similar vocabulary. He is so smug and pseudo-deep with his lean into the mic and go slowly ""Are you sure?"". Man I can just feel how he thought he was so smart and introspective with that ""comeback"". He did this several times when he was stuck.   


**Challenging to a duel**  


Elon is obsessed with physical combat. We all know about the whole thing with Mark Zuckerberg(which his mommy stopped him from doing). It is something that clearly takes up a lot of Elon's psyche. Once again in this ""debate"" he spent a lot of time focusing on setting up a physical duel.  


**Blocking vs muting**  


He tries to get people to use mute instead of blocking people. This has been something Elon is known to be obsessed with. He has made numerous posts about why you should mute people instead of block them. Apparently blocking people uses a lot of server resources so he tries to discourage it.  


**Knowledge of rockets and space**  


Several times Destiny cleverly brought up some kind of analogy about rockets or similar. Elon couldn't help himself but show off about how much he knows in this area. The whole solid versus liquid rocket fuel, and the whole using bombs to blow up space debris. These are things that Elon does have knowledge of and he just can't help but be tricked into going on and on about it.  


**""The very far left are causing the most noise, so how do you deal with that""**  


The far right is mainstream in America. There is no far left, or any left at all that is mainstream. This is a common misconception, especially with Elon. You can go hear absolutely unhinged takes from right wingers just by turning on your TV, and he wants to compare that to some leftist with 90 twitter followers making a shitpost. It is the same false equivalence that Elon does all the time.  


**""Give me an example (of the center left rejecting the far left)""**  


I think this is a minor mis-step by Destiny here (although he still does a good job here). He should have responded with asking for an example of what ""Elon"" thinks the far left is. ""Name one far left person with an inflammatory statement that the center left needs to reject"". It will be impossible for him to name any because none exist, unless he is counting twitter_user_far_left_048471. Again, their simply is no mainstream media or mainstream politician that is far left. The example that Destiny give here is the Bernie Sanders was rejected by the Democratic party, which is true, but Bernie is hardly even left. In any other western country he would considered centrist. Also, if you plot his policies on the political compass he he pretty close to center. Still, it was the best example that could be made in American politics here. Anyway Elon is constantly going on about ""the far left"" and making them out to be some kind of boogeyman, so this is again a typical Elon talking point.  


**""Maybe you just don't appreciate any kind of dark humor?""-Destiny**  


This is my favorite moment in the entire stream. Elon is quite clearly gotten here. He loves to shitpost and go ""oohhh look at me, my humor is so dank, so dark, so edgy, i love dark humor"". Then when it is against something he is for (Trump), all of a sudden he is against it, bans it. So this question really tripped him up. ""I do appreciate dark humor but I don't like to joke about war crimes"". Apparently ""war crimes"" is saying anything bad about something that Elon likes.  


**""Zero is nothing, it cant exist in reality, so you need to put a box around it to make it available in our brainspace.""**  


Typical Elon pointless word salad to make himself sound deep.  


**World War II**  


Elon is a pseudo-intellectual and considers himself an expert in history, particularly World War II. He even got himself on the Dan Carlin history podcast somehow, and you can listen to that episode to hear his incredibly bad amateur takes. His mind is incredibly simple and he can only see the world in black and white terms. He has no capacity to see shades of grey or any nuance. Everything is good or bad. People die bad. War bad. No other thinking needed in his mind. That is why he thinks the atomic bomb should not have been used in World War II, and also Japan shouldn't have been invaded either. He said just to set up a defensive perimeter. This is legit the worst take I have ever heard. He must be fucking terrible at those RTS games he plays.

On 29 Jul 2021, Adrian Dittman created a Twitter account. One of his first tweets was a reply posted 18 minutes after Elon posted his reply; both replies were made to the same account, a user with less than 200 followers; both replies started with, “Haha.” Adrian Dittmann also uses the phrase, ""good point,"" and a simple Google dork (e.g. site:x.com/elonmusk ""good point"") will yield tons of results of Elon using the same words.

https://preview.redd.it/9eeyp7bl13ed1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bbe5f89922bb7325da138d17024e705cbab84e0

In many cases, more than I’m going to post here, Elon and Adrian Dittmann use similar verbiage; and while the words are common in general, the usage is “Interesting!”

https://preview.redd.it/nrt61wkm13ed1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f0f8dc5a6223aae4f80a90380334773dafc7bd

I will also note that Elon’s tweets range in presentation; from brief to lengthy and from memes to professional. Adrian Dittmann’s tweets are typically friendly, but the formatting can be strange. There is often no punctuation, sometimes new sentences on a new line are preceded by a comma, and there are a lot of odd line breaks, which may be caused by the use of voice-to-text. 

\_\_\_

An image Adrian Dittman posted on 2 Mar 2022 included screenshots of his browser. One of the few bookmarks on the browser bar was titled “Gallifreyan translator.”

https://preview.redd.it/96rkyid653ed1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4251c6f977ec04ffecd47c269f3bd579eb004a8

[Gallifreyan](https://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf) is a fictional language used by the Time Lords of Gallifrey, from the British television program *Doctor Who*. Adrian Dittmann’s Twitter avatar was previously a cypher, which, when translated, corresponded to his name. 

https://preview.redd.it/i4fvn3d223ed1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3863ca4e4bdcd885dd28011162d6627ab7003c

If you do a Google search for the term “Gallifreyan translator,” the [first link](https://adrian17.github.io/Gallifreyan/) in the results is for a GitHub page by the same name, owned by the user “adrian17.” Bookmarking that page gives you the exact bookmark that Adrian Dittmann had in his browser. 

Granted, anyone can fork that repo and the bookmark would be the same if saved, however, it’s an odd coincidence given the fact that the owner of that site has the same first name as Dittmann, though the last name is different.

https://preview.redd.it/xsjurdkd23ed1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=131d072792005369beee3f7584208696378c5966

As for the surname “Dittmann,” perhaps it’s a nod to [Jason Dittmann](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2017/04/19/discovery-new-exoplanet-linked-great-falls/100678062/), of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who’s team discovered LHS 1140b, a planet \~39 light years from Earth that could hold the greatest potential for life of any known world outside our solar system, and who’s research has been called, “ambrosia to techno-science geeks.”

“Dittmann” is also a Germanic surname, and both Adrian Dittmann and Elon have posted tweets in German. Adrian Dittmann, in several tweets, also referenced Giga Berlin, the manufacturing plant for Tesla located in Berlin-Brandenburg Germany. 

\_\_\_

Each tweet used in this post has a number in the bottom right corner that corresponds to the status ID of the tweet, if you'd like to confirm the validity of the images. In some cases, the tweet has been deleted, but is available through the Wayback Machine.

\_\_\_

If you made it this far, congratulations. All of this is circumstantial, of course, and each of these points alone don't add up to much. But when put together, there is a curious amount of coincidence. Therefore, I would agree with the consensus that **Elon Musk is Adrian Dittmann**. "

# Elon Musk and Cryptocurrencies: Analyzing Allegations of White Supremacist Links and Modern Financial Apartheid



## Abstract

Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, attracting both mainstream and fringe groups. This article delves into the controversial theory that Elon Musk, a significant figure in the tech and cryptocurrency worlds, along with certain white supremacist groups, uses cryptocurrencies as tools to advance segregationist agendas. It compares the misuse of cryptocurrencies to modern financial apartheid practices, examining the implications for societal integration and economic justice.



## Introduction

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is a prominent advocate for cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Dogecoin. His influence on the cryptocurrency market is substantial, often leading to significant price fluctuations. However, a controversial theory suggests that Musk, alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, leverages cryptocurrencies to advance segregationist and supremacist ideologies. This article investigates these claims and compares the misuse of cryptocurrencies to modern tools of financial apartheid, exploring the broader societal implications.



## The Rise of Cryptocurrencies and Extremist Interests

Cryptocurrencies are valued for their decentralization, anonymity, and resistance to censorship. These characteristics appeal to various groups, including those with extremist ideologies, who seek to evade regulatory oversight and promote their agendas.



### Cryptocurrencies and Extremist Groups

1. \*\*Anonymity and Decentralization:\*\* The anonymity and lack of central control inherent in cryptocurrencies align with extremist goals to avoid detection and circumvent regulation.

2. \*\*Historical Context:\*\* Extremist groups have a history of undermining governmental control and promoting segregation, viewing cryptocurrencies as effective tools for these purposes.

3. \*\*Use in Illegal Activities:\*\* Cryptocurrencies have been utilized by extremist groups to fund illegal activities, including propaganda dissemination, recruitment, and terrorism financing.



## Elon Musk's Influence in the Cryptocurrency Space

Elon Musk's involvement in cryptocurrencies has significantly impacted market dynamics. His public statements and social media activity can cause rapid price changes, underscoring his influential role.



### Musk's Advocacy and Market Influence

1. \*\*Bitcoin:\*\* Musk's endorsement of Bitcoin, highlighted by Tesla's $1.5 billion investment, has significantly boosted its mainstream acceptance.

2. \*\*Dogecoin:\*\* Musk's promotion of Dogecoin, often in a light-hearted manner, has led to substantial price increases and speculative trading.

3. \*\*Environmental Concerns:\*\* Musk's critiques of Bitcoin's environmental impact have influenced market sentiment and sparked discussions on sustainable mining practices.



### Allegations of Extremist Links

The theory linking Musk to white supremacist groups lacks substantial evidence but merits exploration due to its serious implications.



1. \*\*Social Media Influence:\*\* Musk's vast social media presence could be seen as a platform for indirectly supporting or promoting extremist ideologies without explicit endorsement.

2. \*\*Market Manipulation:\*\* Musk's ability to influence cryptocurrency prices raises questions about his motivations and potential links to groups seeking financial gain or societal disruption.

3. \*\*Speculative Connections:\*\* Some theorists suggest that Musk's disruptive approach to business and technology could align with extremist goals of destabilizing traditional structures.



## Modern Financial Apartheid: Tools of Segregation and Control

Financial apartheid refers to systemic financial practices that segregate and marginalize specific populations, perpetuating economic inequality and social stratification.



### Historical and Modern Contexts

1. \*\*Redlining:\*\* Historically, redlining practices excluded minority communities from accessing housing loans, reinforcing racial segregation and economic disparity.

2. \*\*Predatory Lending:\*\* Modern predatory lending practices disproportionately target marginalized communities, trapping them in cycles of debt and financial instability.

3. \*\*Access to Capital:\*\* Disparities in access to capital and investment opportunities continue to reinforce economic inequalities and hinder societal integration.



### Cryptocurrencies as a Tool for Modern Financial Apartheid

The misuse of cryptocurrencies by extremist groups and influential figures can be likened to modern financial apartheid practices, as both serve to segregate and control marginalized populations.



1. \*\*Economic Exclusion:\*\* Cryptocurrencies, while promoting financial inclusion, can also facilitate economic exclusion by enabling illegal activities that disproportionately affect vulnerable communities.

2. \*\*Wealth Transfer and Segregation:\*\* Cryptocurrencies are being used to transfer wealth to white individuals who haven't earned it, allowing them to move away from integrated areas and reinforce segregation.

3. \*\*Theft and Anonymity:\*\* Cryptocurrencies are used to steal from Black communities and hide the identities of those involved in these crimes, exacerbating economic and social disparities.

4. \*\*Destabilization:\*\* The volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies can lead to economic instability, disproportionately impacting those without financial literacy or access to traditional financial services.



## The Ethics and Implications of Cryptocurrency Use

The potential misuse of cryptocurrencies by influential individuals and extremist groups poses significant ethical and regulatory challenges.



### Addressing Ethical Concerns

1. \*\*Regulation and Oversight:\*\* Implementing robust regulatory measures to mitigate the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal or unethical purposes is crucial.

2. \*\*Transparency and Accountability:\*\* Promoting transparency in cryptocurrency transactions and holding influential figures accountable for market manipulation and unethical behavior is essential.

3. \*\*Public Awareness:\*\* Raising awareness about the ethical implications of cryptocurrency use can inform better decision-making among investors and the public.



### Potential Regulatory Measures

1. \*\*Enhanced KYC/AML Requirements:\*\* Strengthening Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to reduce anonymity and prevent misuse.

2. \*\*Market Oversight:\*\* Implementing stricter market oversight to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading practices.

3. \*\*Banning Privacy Coins:\*\* Considering bans on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies that offer enhanced anonymity features used to evade regulation.



## Conclusion

The allegations that Elon Musk and certain extremist groups use cryptocurrencies as tools for white supremacist agendas and financial apartheid are controversial and largely speculative. However, the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to facilitate illegal activities and perpetuate economic segregation is a pressing concern. As the regulatory landscape evolves, addressing these ethical and societal challenges will be crucial to ensure that cryptocurrencies can contribute positively to global financial systems and promote economic justice for all."

"373","2024-08-03","Am I the only one who is worried about Elon tipping the election in favor of Trump?","I never used Xitter much before, but after reading so many crazy posts from Elon on reddit, the last few days I started checking in directly on Xitter. And I am very surprised by how much Elon posts, how much of it is very Maga-aligned and how many engagements he gets!?   
  
He has around 193 mio followers (probably inflated, sure) and he seems to write at least a couple of posts a day in favor of Trump which gets 20 - 140 mio views, and up to 1 mio likes.   
In comparison Kamala has 20.5 mio followers, her posts gets around .5 - 5 mio views and around  5k - 135k likes.   
  
Elon is very likely the worlds most influential political influencer while being the worlds richest man who has access to so much data through Xitter.  And now he is involved with that American PAC which sounds like they are going to use methods similar to Cambridge Analytics.

Am I the only one who is concerned about his abilities to tip the scale in favor of Trump?"

He's stressed, hated, in fear and becoming more and more deranged. I don't think he really thinks ahead or considers consequences any more. He's desperate to get Trump elected because he thinks Trump take the heat off him. He figures what the heck, go for it, no matter how dicey or illegal, I'll do my best to help Trump and Trump will pardon it all. I think he's going to make some catastrophic mistakes over the next few months. "

I am deeply concerned about the potential harm to our democratic processes. I see Elon Musk as a clear and present danger to the United States of America; he is not a U.S citizen, but his profound influence and the reach of his businesses have far-reaching implications.

Musk's various ventures, such as Tesla, SpaceX, and X, among others, have extensive contracts with numerous U.S government agencies. Such engagements give him considerable influence. It's troubling to see the potential for interference in the democratic process in the upcoming 2024 elections. This isn't just about one person's rights, but our collective right to free and fair elections.

Notably, U.S. Federal Law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing, donating or spending funds in connection with any federal, state, or local election in the United States, either directly or indirectly [Federal Election Commission]. It is therefore crucial that we closely scrutinize and regulate interactions between government and individuals with significant influence who are not U.S citizens.

For the sake of our democracy, we must ensure that all interactions in our electoral process are beyond reproach. I implore the U.S. government to take immediate action and terminate all contracts with Elon Musk and his companies. We need to uphold the integrity of our democratic processes, leaving no room for undue influence. Please sign this petition to signal your support for this crucial matter"

Pretty sure Elon's not that smart. But other political pollsters have picked up on how poisonous Elon is, and they've started to ask people what they think about him. The more you see Elon tied to Trump by Dems, the more you know the public at large is really starting to turn against Elon.

Elon Musk finally satisfied the demands and provided a list of shareholders of ""X Holding Corp"", who helped the billionaire buy Twitter. And who do you think were the investors of the X platform, besides the Islamists and the Trump lobby? That's right, Petr Aven and Vadim Moshkovich. Now it is absolutely obvious where Musk gets such love for Russia and where the ""filters"" come from because of anti-Russian publications. Let me remind you who Aven and Moshkovich are.

Petr Aven is a Russian billionaire, the founder of ""Alfa Group"", which is one of the main wallets for Putin. This person is maximally controlled by the Kremlin, for example, in 2018, he and his colleague Fridman went to Washington to lobby on behalf of the Russian government for the lifting of international sanctions against the Russian Federation. Aven is one of Putin's oldest friends. In general, without Petr's intervention, Putin would be in prison, and not become president. After all, Aven covered for Vladimir Putin in 1992, when he organized an illegal trade in export licenses. Aven urgently approved him as an authorized representative of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations with the right to foreign economic activity, thereby saving the future dictator from prison. Aven was also present at a meeting with Putin on February 24, 2022, in honor of the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. He did not express any protest, began ""SVO"" and silently supported Putin. By the way, he, together with Fridman, is trying to lift sanctions from himself, just yesterday he received another refusal in this matter. 
In the purchase of Twitter, he is represented by the company ""8VC Opportunities Fund II, L.P."", where his son Denis works. 

Vadim Moshkovich is a sanctioned Russian agricultural billionaire who was a member of the ""Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation"". In other words, he was officially part of Putin's closest circle. Moshkovich owns the largest agricultural holding in Russia, Rusagro. Naturally, he was also present at the meeting with Putin on February 24, 2022, and, like Aven, did not express any protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

He is represented in the purchase of Twitter by the company ""8VC Opportunities Fund II, L.P."", where his son Jack (Eugene) works.

Also an interesting person is Al-Waleed ibn Talal Al Saud, who, both personally and through his company Kingdom Holding Company, is represented in the list of investors three times. This person continues his investment business in Russia and does not publicly support Hamas in the war against Israel. In terms of investments in Russia, he regularly cooperates with Rosneft, Lukoil and Gazprom.

Knowing all this, how can one even discuss Elon Musk's bias? Everyone was wondering how it was possible that Twitter shares (X) were falling, advertisers were breaking contracts, and no one was doing anything. This is direct damage to investors. But what everyone failed to take into account is that investors don't care about profits, they need a platform to push their narratives, such as: supporting Putin and Russia; lobbying to freeze the war in Ukraine; removing the Ukrainian agenda from the top news; the righteousness of Hamas' activities, etc.

It is now obvious that all the changes in Twitter that are ruining this wonderful platform are a consequence of Elon Musk's cooperation with people like Moszkowitz and Aven."

Elmo is a cute cuddly monster who is beloved by millions and teaches children about sharing and acceptance. He is curious about the world and eager to learn from people who are wiser than him. He asks questions. He makes mistakes and learns from them. When he accidentally hurts someone, he feels bad and sincerely apologizes. He tries to love everyone regardless of who they are. Elmo is pretty much the exact opposite of Elon. I genuinely can't imagine a worse nickname for the guy. 

If you had one cookie and Elmo had three, Elmo would give you a cookie so you both had two. If you had one cookie and Elon had three billion, Elon would tell you he needs your cookie so he can preserve the light of cookie consciousness and use it to train Full Self Baking, which will definitely be ready for a full release next year.

Besides, if you want to make a juvenile nickname out of his name there are better ones that don't conjure the image of a character from the children's television GOAT, like Elno (hell no), Msuk, Skum"

He tried to tell me how a search engine works, me, but it gets even more hilarious. He couldn't cope with the Musk hate or how I wouldn't tolerate his baseless conspiracy theories, so he decided I'm NOT a software developer!

As a black woman, I’ve always been aware that none of the social advances we benefited from should be taken for granted.

But to be flooded with posts calling to repeal the 19th amendment, to bring back segregation.. is just disappointing. 

I’ll admit that I had really high expectations of Elon and what he would do to improve twitter. But, like many, I’ve been let down when I found out it was nothing more than another tool for him to advance his far-right agenda and erase the social progress we’ve made over the past 60 years. 

It’s now very clear what kind of value he wanted to extract from twitter, and he’s 100x worse than George Soros and all the billionaires he claims are secretly pulling strings to manipulate populations.

Don’t think he’s tweaked the algorithm per se to show more racist stuff, he most likely just amplified his own account, through which he likes, retweets, comments useless stuff like “!!” “concerning 😳”, thus increasing reach. And conveniently hid likes so people wouldn’t face the social cost of engaging with problematic content.

That way if anyone audits twitter’s algo (which is no longer open source btw), he can just claim he never pushed RW content directly. 

Why boost his own account? 
1. His fucking ego.
2. Well, he’s the owner and de facto head of the platform, regularly runs polls for users and shares company updates, he wants them to reach as many users as possible right?  That would be a good excuse. A certainly a trojan horse to justify pushing racist content to everyone’s feed.

I’m pretty sure an ex Twitter engineer came out & told folks Elon threw a fit because his account was losing reach, and asked them to boost it. Could be fake, but would make sense. Proof: I’ve opened a new account as a test, to have a blank, neutral algorithm. Then engaged with wide-ranging topics unrelated to him/politics/tech. 

Turns out, Elon’s posts still came out at the top of my For You page nearly systematically. The accounts he regularly engaged with (race scientists, eugenicists, own the wokes type bs) also popped up regularly despite me ignoring them and not following a single user.

This is by design.

And I think people who feel this way should leave twitter too, en masse, to make a statement. We’re not his fucking pawns."

Examples [here](https://x.com/ChuckCallesto/status/1834296905603461335?t=k53UdfdbBMJS8J_OomxDkA&s=19), [here](https://x.com/TonySeruga/status/1834346034727928084?t=k53UdfdbBMJS8J_OomxDkA&s=19), [here](https://x.com/NewsTreason/status/1834310626656526420?t=k53UdfdbBMJS8J_OomxDkA&s=19), and [here](https://x.com/HeyTammyBruce/status/1834373622967763070?t=k53UdfdbBMJS8J_OomxDkA&s=19). However, most importantly [here](https://x.com/LeadingReport/status/1834303917208842424?t=JF7esOIgyoRVhTQAA032jw&s=19), which at the time of writing this, currently has 10 million views.

The problem? **It's all fake.** I don't just mean that it's taken out of context, or that the truth was twisted - what I mean is that *the entire story was made up.* So, I took the time to track down the [original source](https://x.com/DocNetyoutube/status/1834280373230207089?t=9D0--xhfn6rI-6D_TmAfBw&s=19), which as you can see, is simply a tweet.

> I will be releasing an affidavit from an ABC whistleblower regarding the debate. I have just signed a non-disclosure agreement with the attorney of the whistleblower. The affidavit states how the Harris campaign was given sample question which were essentially the same questions that were given during the debate and separate assurances of fact checking Donald Trump and that she would NOT be fact checked. Accordingly, the affidavit states several other factors that were built into the debate to give Kamala a significant advantage. I have seen and read the affidavit and after the attorney blacks out the name of the whistleblower and other information that could dox the whistleblower, I will release the full affidavit. I will be releasing the affidavit before the weekend is out.

I implore you to read this tweet - as in, read the *actual* tweet, start to finish, and tell me, with a straight face, that what this person said was coherent. Let's go over the blatant logical contradictions here:

1. The author of the tweet claims he signed a NDA **with the whistleblower's lawyer.** This does not make sense - typically, a non-disclosure agreement is signed between an individual and a company/another individual so that the individual can be found liable for leaking confidential information. One does not sign one *with a lawyer* - that is not the purpose of a lawyer. Regardless, let's assume this happened.

2. Right after claiming to have signed the NDA, the author says they are planning on releasing an affidavit from the supposed whistleblower regarding ABC's actions, with all names redacted. **Redacting names in such a manner does NOT void a non-disclosure agreement.** Such a blatant contradiction here makes absolutely no sense.

3. The author has no idea what the term 'affidavit' means. An affidavit is ""a sworn statement in writing made under oath or on affirmation before an authorized magistrate or officer."" However, this case has no legal bounds. It has absolutely nothing to do with law - presumably, the author plans on publicly posting in written form the whistleblower's record of the events that supposedly took place which led them to believe that ABC News bowed to the will of Kamala's campaign.

In short: it is all nonsense. A Twitter user saw the opportunity to become famous for a few hours by claiming to have a bombshell witness testimony of an ABC News employee that just so happens to align with what Conservatives want to hear, and the various right-wing grifters and [fake news outlets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_Report) on Twitter ran with it in order to rile up their base and keep it in a perpetual cycle of fear, and potentially drawing in more conspiracy-minded people. 

Now, the reason why this is dangerous should be obvious, however, what's important to note is Elon Musk (Twitter's owner) constantly attacking ""legacy media"" while promoting ""citizen journalism"" on Twitter as the sole hub of truth and sincerity, free of censorship. What's also important is that the various grifters and propaganda rags linked here are regularly promoted by Elon Musk, often through quote tweets or a reply with a message such as ""!!"", ""Many such cases,"" ""This is actually the truth,"" etc.

The realization should be obvious: this kind of fake news, fearmongering, and promotion of outright false information and dangerous conspiracy theories **is exactly what Elon Musk, as the owner of Twitter, wants to promote as the 'real journalism' the legacy media wants to bury under the rug. **This is extremely dangerous - actions like these erode trust in our democratic system here in America. By promoting outright false information about certain individuals and political parties in America and other countries, users are deceived into believing things that are not true - this ripping apart the fabric of our democratic system.**"

Sounds like a sweet deal—if you’re into playing pretend. People are waiting for their winnings, but surprise, surprise, that money isn’t coming through. Because when it comes to Musk, why settle for just misleading headlines when you can make it a full-blown PR stunt?

Legal experts are already on it, calling this a likely violation of election laws (shocker, right?). Turns out, running a daily million-dollar giveaway smells a lot like an illegal lottery, especially when it’s tied to political influence in swing states. And, bonus points, his PAC is also under investigation for gathering voter data in Michigan. So it’s not just that the promised millions are imaginary—the privacy concerns are very real.

If you’re still holding your breath for Musk’s millions, maybe stop. It’s starting to look like SpaceX isn’t the only thing he’s launching into the void. 🌑

But hey, at least we’ll always have the tweets… and the lawsuits.

For a half-century the Republican Heritage Foundation has been trying to find a way to ""win"" at nuclear war.

>In the 1980's, Reagan's ""Star Wars"" missiles-in-space program was ultimately deemed too expensive due to launch costs. Looking for a solution, the technology head of Strategic Defense Initiative ([Mike Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Griffin)) went to Russia with a young man named **Elon Musk** in 2001 to ""look at ICBMs"" (as the story goes). They came back from Russia and founded SpaceX based on the [landing rocket concept that came out of SDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X).

>Project 2025 has now put out a [video to promote Elon's use of space weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79e8Y2Mgq-0&t=11s) (*warning: Republican propaganda*). although they say it uses ""tungsten slugs"" when in reality the satellites are planning to use hypersonic missiles [developed by a bunch of SpaceX employees](https://www.castelion.com/team) in concert with Northrop Grumman. Heritage Foundation has been the main political proponent of pre-staged orbital missiles since Reagan. They've included this in their [Project 2025](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/time-new-missile-defense-review-and-space-based-missile-defense-overlayer#:~:text=1.%20A%20Space%2Dbased%20Overlayer) and praise Elon's Starlink as proving it's possible. **Trump** now calls it the **""**[**Iron Dome Missile Shield**](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4848896-donald-trump-space-national-guard-iron-dome/)"" and it's part of the GOP platform for the 2024 election.

>In 2019, Elon Musk met 4-star general O’Shaughnessy & Jay Raymond to discuss homeland defense innovation. O'Shaughnessy took their discussion to the United States Senate to pitch a new space-based ""layered missile defense system"" much like [Brilliant Pebbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Pebbles) but powered by artificial intelligence to quickly and lethally act upon hypersonic and ballistic missile threats. [He proposed the acronym SHIELD which stands for Strategic Homeland Integrated Ecosystem for Layered Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht0ulmqvFS8&t=788s).

>This system would consist of a satellite constellation in orbit equipped with infrared sensors and eventually ICBM interception capability. The **U.S. Space Force** was established later that year and **O’Shaughnessy joined SpaceX** where he now leads their StarSHIELD division.  
SpaceX started deploying these special military variants of their satellites in 2023, launching them interspersed and connected to other Starlink satellites. The first StarSHIELD satellites host infrared sensors designed by L3Harris to detect and track missiles and perform fire-control functions.

>SpaceX’s first StarSHIELD contracts were with the Space Development Agency and announced in 2020. The SDA was conceived and established by Under Secretary of Defense (R&E) Mike Griffin, who was previously the Deputy of Technology at Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. It is interesting to note that [Griffin has an extensive history with Elon Musk during the early years of SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Griffin#Career#:~:text=Elon) . While these first tranches of SDA satellites are focused on communication, missile detection and tracking, Griffin and others have said that including [space-based interceptor weapons in later layers will be ""relatively easy""](https://breakingdefense.com/2018/08/space-based-missile-defense-is-doable-dod-rd-chief-griffin/) and he now works with SpaceX employees and primes on an interceptor with a company called Castelion in El Segundo. The interceptors are hypersonic glide vehicles (like FOBS) that re-enter from LEO and maintain contact with the satellites through phased array communication, the constellation above gives continued guidance to the interceptor to descend from space and hit an ICBM at launch or other ground target within enemy territory.

To those who know the full story, the stakes are now enormous and Elon's talks with Putin mark a dangerous juncture in world history. 

As is widely reported, Musk first went to Moscow in 2002 with Jim Cantrell and [Mike Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Griffin#Career)\--who was then president of In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA & DARPA. At the time, they said it was a ""shopping trip for discount rockets"" as part of a Mars plant-growing publicity stunt they named [Mars Oasis](https://marspedia.org/images/9/99/2001_TMS_Conv_Sched.pdf). Elon colorfully told his biographer Ashley Vance that during the trip the Russians mocked them for trying to buy ICBMs and ""spit on his shoes"", prompting him to fly back to the U.S. to start the now famous company SpaceX that would later compete with the Russian space program. 

Elon continued to further embellish the story over the years, telling Walter Isaacson they were so despondent with the Russian meeting that they got drunk on vodka, whereafter he passed out and ""his head slammed into the table"". Of course his evolving apocryphal story was widely questioned, and now a much more coherent explanation for their trip emerges with Mike Griffin's role becoming evident. Programs and efforts of both Elon and Griffin make plain the original intentions of their trip as we turn back the pages of history.

For nearly a half-century, the Republican Heritage Foundation has been trying to find a way to ""win"" at nuclear war. Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, or ""Star Wars"" missiles-in-space program was called a crowning achievement towards this effort in the 1980s. The concept involved staging thousands of weapons in orbit, called interceptors, that would shoot down other missiles including nuclear ICBMs in flight. Because the interceptors were constantly orbiting the entire planet as a constellation of satellites, there was always at least one close-by that could deorbit and attack a target in any country within a matter of minutes (e.g, during the initial launch of a Russian ICBM.) Ultimately SDI was mothballed in the '90s with Congressional concerns that it violated the ABM Treaty and that the rocket launches to stage the many one-ton weapons-bus satellites in low Earth orbit would cost too much.

An important detail is that Mike Griffin was [in fact](https://www.mda.mil/about/griffin.html#:~:text=the%20Deputy%20for%20Technology%20at%20the%20Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative%20Organization) the Deputy of Technology for the Strategic Defense Initiative.

In the '90s, after the setbacks with Congress, Griffin regrouped and led a study with the Heritage Foundation under ""Team B"" that examined ways to reduce launch costs for SDI by using *reusable rockets*. It also advocated for ""the ABM Treaty to be declared null and void"" arguing on technicalities that Russia had already violated it. George W. Bush subsequently adopted these recommendations and abandoned the ABM Treaty in 2002. Only a few months later, Griffin and Elon Musk took that famous trip to Russia.

Eric Berger's book *Liftoff* notes that Musk initially offered Griffin the position of Chief Engineer at the newly-formed SpaceX, but that he ""instead chose to continue his work in Washington DC."" Musk founded SpaceX without any experience in aerospace, but managed to somehow get their first contract funded by DARPA as part of a global weapons strike program called the [DARPA FALCON Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Falcon_Project). Musk soon after dubbed his rocket the ""Falcon 1"" which he says was ""named after Star Wars"" (but oft-interpreted as the Millennium Falcon rather than Reagan's global missile strike program--for many years he kept this ambiguous). Around the same time, Elon named his own son ""Griffin Musk"".

Mike Griffin soon rocked the space industry when he was appointed by G.W. Bush as NASA Administrator, being sworn in by Dick Cheney in 2005. He proceeded to gut the Earth Science Division and realign NASA funding and development programs with DoD priorities. Perhaps his most impactful action, however, was [to funnel a total of \~$2 billion of public funds into Elon's new SpaceX company, before the company had even proven a single launch.](https://archive.today/o/D2zIG/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-spacex-became-nasas-go-to-ride-orbit) This ended up being >[85% of SpaceX's funding](https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/C3PO/GriffinMD/GriffinMD_1-12-13.htm#:~:text=Substantial%20amounts%20of%20money) with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund personally providing only \~15%.  Despite this, Musk played up stories of him braving the financial risks and fully funding the company.

SpaceX of course would go on to further develop rocket technology with extensive government expertise, funds, plans and personnel. His rocket booster landing concept originally [came out of of the SDI program](https://www.newsmax.com/henryfcooper/spacex-strategic-defense-initiative-sdi/2019/06/06/id/919214/#:~:text=until-,Elon,-Musk) under the name [DC-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X). Griffin calling it, ""government R&D at its finest"" and Elon later acknowledged the same saying his company was ""just continuing the great work of the DC-X project"".

During the Democratic Obama administration, SpaceX continued developing technical elements of the program while cultivating a fresh public image, casting SpaceX's brand as a inclusive New Space company that was simply seeking the ambitious goal of bringing humanity to Mars.  This allowed him to recruit young idealistic engineers that would not otherwise consider working for a defense contractor. These employees, most of which do not have a security clearance--and are largely unaware of Musk's broader intentions--have poured their lives into working for the company, often at below-market salaries. 

However with the incoming Trump Administration in 2017 things began to shift.  A flurry of new actions between Elon and Griffin took place again. The most visible of which being contracting between Griffin's new [Space Development Agency (SDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Development_Agency) and Musk's [StarSHIELD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starshield).

...The story picks up [in this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/1gbd7kg/elon_musk_is_insanely_dangerous/).

[Mike Griffin and Elon Musk meet in Washington, DC in April 2005. Attending behind Griffin is Larry Williams--then SpaceX VP of Strategic Relations and former VP of Teledesic, the first LEO satellite internet company.  Teledesic also had SDI links, but went bankrupt a few months after SpaceX was founded.](https://preview.redd.it/12tajewldgxd1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cfc7a1b493f59a2541e48525a1d2129b0ea8d53)"

The government should only get involved if something illegal has been posted to the platform eg csam or terrorism posts for how to to make a bomb. 

But a government official should not be able to have access to ordinary law abiding citizens accounts and DM's. You can argue that other platforms have access to this, but Elon can easily use information against users who might be critics, journalists, politicans and whistleblowers of the government, Elon or Trump. Keep in mind there is rumours for twitter and truth social to merge, and trump himself stated previously he plans to go after people who have wronged him.
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-enemies-election-president-harris-biden-b2643171.html 

Also keep in mind, Elon and Trump can easily manipulate trends, and make sure to reduce traction to posts that they may not agree with or even ban these users. 

Words like cis have already been censored by Elon himself, is they're any others that he can use?

This included persons with even minor technical incongruities in their citizenship forms and documentation.

The Trump team knows that Musk [obtained his citizenship fraudulently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/26/elon-musk-immigration-status/), having been working illegally prior to naturalization. If/when Elon becomes inconvenient, the Trump administration can strip him of his assets, denaturalize him, and ship him back to South Africa.

Ironically, Elon fought for Trump to get elected because he feared persecution under a Harris administration, but the consequences of a Trump administration disagreement could be far more grave for the billionaire. Many around Trump probably see Elon as a ""useful idiot"", to be disposed of once he has run his course."

Here is what is actually going on.","I'm sure you've seen [screenshots](https://x.com/Libsofbluesky/status/1859329315957244286?t=zkZD_DX7qWo9cLHq_hw3UQ&s=19) shared around of accounts calling themselves MAPs (Minor Attracted Person), paedophiles, and proclaiming that intercourse with children is totally normal, all while proudly showing off their pronouns and the fact that they are leftists and part of the LGBT community. These screenshots are being shared everywhere across Twitter at the moment, specifically by those in Elon Musk's close orbit, and I *guarantee* that he is going to tweet about it to show that the LGBT community is full of groomers and pedophiles.


This is incredibly infuriating, stressful, and just *tiring.* Like I'm panicking to type this out and warn people about this. I shouldn't need to tell you that pedophiles aren't protected members of the LGBT community- we want absolutely *nothing* to do with that shit, and absolutely **none** hang out in our spaces. We absolutely *despise* pedophiles, and I personally want nothing more than for them to be isolated from society so they can never harm children ever again.

That's not the point though, the point of all of this is to smear us, and leftists at large. I've actually done my due diligence and had a look at all the accounts spewing out this disgusting bile on Bluesky, and they were all created within the past week, all use emojis and the same exact typing quirks (that being an empty parody of tumblrspeak), and all use the same exact mannerisms. 

**None of these accounts are real.** They are trolls attempting to link us with the most disgusting behaviors imaginable, so that the far-right has the necessary ""evidence"" to deem LGBT+ members a threat to society, and they are taking advantage of a fledgling social media platform that just gained millions of users overnight in order to do so, a platform whose moderation team isn't equipped to handle this.

This is not the first time the far-right has posed as pedophiles attempting to cozy up to the LGBT+ community. [They did that exact same thing in 2019](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/posing-gay-men-twitter-troll-goes-viral-attempts-falsely-tie-n954721). So please, share this around - to your friends, and your parents; let them know that the accounts they are seeing aren't real."

He has been on a tear with this recently. Given his role with ""DOGE"" and general influence with the new administration, I don't think this is just one of Musk's many tangential or spontaneous hate-fests, I'm pretty sure this is a deliberate attempt to get ahead of some of the things he wants to propose:

A - He will obviously want to defund any government support that helps the homeless, and do this by reframing homeless people as being virtually 100% evil menaces to society. 

B - By the same token, he wants to ""solve"" the homeless problem in San Francisco and other cities. This has long been an obsession of his, albeit in a more background way than currently. And his ""solution"" is going to be rounding them all up and locking them away as permanently as possible. And, so again, he needs to reframe homeless people as uncontrollable menaces, ""not like the rest of us"" - so that people are cool with civil protections magically not applying to them."

He’s essentially regurgitating bad takes from the F-35’s most notorious and egotistical detractors, amplifying Chinese propaganda (while China spends billions in an attempt to copy the plane), and drawing simplistic conclusions based on a superficial understanding of drone warfare in Ukraine and his own ignorance of stealth technology and radar. 

The always entertaining Lazerpig on YouTube has responded with a rather good takedown. Enjoy. (If you want to skip straight to the F-35 stuff it begins at 8:45)

Musk is the richest man on the planet but wasn’t smart enough to consider that renaming Twitter as X would destroy a huge chunk of its value. This strikes me as a pretty a slam dunk case of someone with poor reasoning skills.
