In my new book, I try to understand our Founding Document by following its original 1789 meaning as closely as possible, muskets, quill pens, and all. r/politics, AMA!","r/politics, thank ye so much for all the great questions! And thank ye Qu1nlan for making it hapepn. I loved our civil discourse, and I think the Founders would be proud of us. I have to go to an interview, but I'll check back and try to answer more questions later. If you want to know more about the THE YEAR OF LIVING CONSTITUTIONALLY please go here: [https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622521/the-year-of-living-constitutionally-by-aj-jacobs/](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622521/the-year-of-living-constitutionally-by-aj-jacobs/). Your humble and obedient servant, A.J.   Hello Reddit,  I’m A.J. Jacobs. I’m an author. I wrote a book several years ago called “The Year of Living Biblically” about following the rules of the Bible as literally as possible.  My new book is a semi-sequel to that, and is called “The Year of Living Constitutionally.” I try to understand our Founding Document by following its original 1789 meaning. I bore my musket on the Upper West Side of New York. I gave up social media in favor of writing pamphlets with a quill pen. I agreed to quarter some soldiers in my apartment.  The book is (I hope) entertaining, but it also has a serious purpose: To explore how we should interpret this 230-year-old document. How much should we stick to the original meaning, and how much should we evolve the meaning? I do a deep dive into democracy, SCOTUS, originalism, and much more. Booklist calls it ""fascinating  and necessary"" and Harvard's Laurence Tribe says ""everyone should read it."" I have also written some other books, such as “Thanks a Thousand” — where I went around the world and thanked a thousand people who had anything to do with my morning cup of coffee.  “The Know-It-All” — where I read the Encyclopedia Britannica (when it still existed in physical form)  “Drop Dead Healthy” — where I tried to be the healthiest person alive.  “It’s All Relative” — where I tried to throw a family reunion for eight billion of my cousins.  Ask me anything! (Proof here: https://imgur.com/61QnBWM)"
