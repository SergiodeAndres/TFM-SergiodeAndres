Not much in space news yesterday except for the elephant in the room that is the SpaceX launch of the Jason 3 satellite and the exploding barge following the booster landing. According to a tweet from SpaceX’s Elon Musk, the barge landing would have been a success if not for a  landing leg which did not locked properly. Still, they did achieved a pretty soft landing , and that’s a significant improvement from the last two barge landings. 

* On SpaceX barge landing

In any case, the main mission objective was a total success. Falcon 9 did brought Jason 3 into his orbit and ground control expect to activate his science instruments over the next few days. The primary objective of the satellite will be to monitor the height of the ocean surface. This is a direct continuation of what his predecessor, Jason 2, was doing. Jason 3 will be doing a full observation cycle of the planet every 10 days until the next satellite, Jason-CS, replace him in 2020.

"7","2016-01-20","Question about what the intention is even if SpaceX manages a successful landing of the Falcon 9 on a barge.","After watching the most recent attempt at landing the Falcon 9 on a barge, and seeing how easily it can to tip over and explode, I was wondering what they intend to do with this capability even if they managed to land it successfully. I get that it is more advantageous because it has lower launch mass, it's safer, and less positioning and traveling requirements. But it seems like the water and winds need to maintain perfect conditions for this to work. And this wouldn't always be the case in the middle of an ocean or a large body of water. Waves and winds will still make it unstable. The video of the most recent attempt makes wonder how do they plan to bring it back thru choppy waters and to safety even if they manage to nail the landing?
Even if the plan is to just refuel it on a barge and then fly it back to land to reuse it, that still sounds like it won't work if the conditions in the middle of the Atlantic or Pacific aren't ideal. I believe the Atlantic is the plan.

Sorry if this has been discussed before."

Two scientist from the Californian Institute of Technology in Pasadena announced the discovery of a potential ninth planet in our solar system. The Neptune-sized planet would be on an elliptical orbit having the closest approach to the sun at 200 AU and the most distant approach between 600 and 12 000 AU. The duo have already booked some time at the Subaru Telescope in hope of finding direct proof of the existence of the new planet.

The Blue Origin just allows people to experience space for a few short minutes. It's a travel experience, and brief. 

SpaceX on the other hand just proved a way to take materials and payloads to space on the cheap, opening up doors for all kinds of investment. 

From a business perspective Blue Origin is cute. But SpaceX just proved to me there's a cost-effective way to make substantial money in space. This is the foundation that drives investments, competition, new tech, etc.

Unfortunately mitigation can only reduce the amount of orbiting waste produced by each launch, it can’t stop [satellites from colliding]( http://listverse.com/2015/05/13/10-spectacular-satellite-collisions/) with one another or even [spontaneously exploding](http://spacenews.com/20-year-old-military-weather-satellite-apparently-exploded-in-orbit/), thereby creating clouds of potentially hazardous debris. At present SpaceX seems intent on becoming a mainstream satellite operator, at least judging by the number of [Satellite Development Jobs]( http://www.spacex.com/careers/list) advertised for their Seattle Satellite facility. Eventually they even intend to launch their incredibly large Mars Colonial Transporter which could be retained in LEO for extended periods, while it waits to be fully refuelled and crewed, in preparation for the run on Mars. 

""if you do a densified liquid methalox rocket with on-orbit refueling, so like you load the spacecraft into orbit and then you send a whole bunch of refueling missions to fill up the tanks and you have the Mars colonial fleet - essentially - that gets built up during the time between Earth-Mars synchronizations, which occur every 26 months,"" ~ [Elon Musk at MIT](http://shitelonsays.com/transcript/elon-musk-at-mits-aeroastro-centennial-part-2-of-6-2014-10-24)

Unfortunately both their internet satellite constellation and the MCT fleet will become increasingly vulnerable to collisions with orbital debris as their numbers grow. It also seems likely that any such collisions could generate even more debris which would then cross the same orbits, i.e. the ones they intend to use. So from this perspective it could be argued that solving the problem of space junk (at least as it affects those specific LEO orbits) could become one of SpaceX’s future priorities.

The problem of how to remove thousands of tiny artefacts, each occupying their own idiosyncratic orbit, seems pretty insurmountable using contemporary techniques. So logically there needs to be some evolution of technology to make the space junk problem more tractable. (Well here we go on the future tech and damn the downvotes!) Judging by the evidence of NASA’s paper on [EmDrive](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-nasa-eagleworks-confirms-paper-controversial-space-propulsion-under-peer-review-1551210) they seem convinced that it actually works and their results have certainly been verified by many [independent researchers]( http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/04/emdrive-may-be-explained-by-quantized.html):-

“Various teams around the world have begun to build their own versions of the EmDrive and put them through their paces. And to everyone’s surprise, they’ve begun to reproduce Shawyer’s results. The EmDrive, it seems, really does produce thrust. In total, six independent experiments have backed Shawyer’s original claims.”

EmDrive has even been [confirmed by a leading space propulsion debunker]( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-dr-martin-tajmar-generates-thrust-test-controversial-space-propulsion-technology-1513151):-

“German professor Dr Martin Tajmar has presented results on experiments conducted with the controversial electromagnetic space propulsion technology EmDrive that he claims shows the theoretical technology generated thrust.”

More importantly the Emdrive design appears relatively simple to construct, inexpensive and robust, at least judging by the experience of this [independent engineer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXG3xqFUf3A&feature=youtu.be#t=1514).

A small satellite equipped with an EmDrive and lightweight solar cells (such as thin film [perovskite panels]( https://news.stanford.edu/2016/04/06/pressure-solar-perovskite-040616/)) could in theory collect orbital debris indefinitely, without the need for refuelled, operating almost completely autonomously. It’s mission might even extend to delivering that debris to an orbiting depository, where it could be recycled as 3D printer feedstock for use in [orbital manufacturing](http://spacenews.com/nasa-made-in-space-think-big-with-archinaut-a-robotic-3d-printing-demo-bound-for-iss/). Using hundreds of such satellites, buzzing around LEO like bees, this could essentially reduce the threat from space junk to virtually zero. So what do people think of this proposition, prudent money-spinner or unspeakable ordure?

Unfortunately both their internet satellite constellation and the MCT fleet will become increasingly vulnerable to collisions with orbital debris as their numbers grow. It also seems likely that any such collisions could generate even more debris which would then cross the same orbits, i.e. the ones they intend to use. So from this perspective it could be argued that solving the problem of space junk (at least as it affects those specific LEO orbits) could become one of SpaceX’s future priorities.

The problem of how to remove thousands of tiny artefacts, each occupying their own idiosyncratic orbit, seems pretty insurmountable using contemporary techniques. So logically there needs to be some evolution of technology to make the space junk problem more tractable. (Well here we go on the future tech and damn the downvotes!) Judging by the evidence of NASA’s paper on [EmDrive](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-nasa-eagleworks-confirms-paper-controversial-space-propulsion-under-peer-review-1551210) they seem convinced that it actually works and their results have certainly been verified by many [independent researchers]( http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/04/emdrive-may-be-explained-by-quantized.html):-

“Various teams around the world have begun to build their own versions of the EmDrive and put them through their paces. And to everyone’s surprise, they’ve begun to reproduce Shawyer’s results. The EmDrive, it seems, really does produce thrust. In total, six independent experiments have backed Shawyer’s original claims.”

EmDrive has even been [confirmed by a leading space propulsion debunker]( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-dr-martin-tajmar-generates-thrust-test-controversial-space-propulsion-technology-1513151):-

“German professor Dr Martin Tajmar has presented results on experiments conducted with the controversial electromagnetic space propulsion technology EmDrive that he claims shows the theoretical technology generated thrust.”

More importantly the Emdrive design appears relatively simple to construct, inexpensive and robust, at least judging by the experience of this [independent engineer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXG3xqFUf3A&feature=youtu.be#t=1514).

A small satellite equipped with an EmDrive and lightweight solar cells (such as thin film [perovskite panels]( https://news.stanford.edu/2016/04/06/pressure-solar-perovskite-040616/)) could in theory collect orbital debris indefinitely, without the need for refuelled, operating almost completely autonomously. It’s mission might even extend to delivering that debris to an orbiting depository, where it could be recycled as 3D printer feedstock for use in [orbital manufacturing](http://spacenews.com/nasa-made-in-space-think-big-with-archinaut-a-robotic-3d-printing-demo-bound-for-iss/). Using hundreds of such satellites, buzzing around LEO like bees, this could essentially reduce the threat from space junk to virtually zero. So what do people think of this proposition, prudent money-spinner or unspeakable ordure?

It doesn't matter if it's one of the companies that is working on getting there and others have already gotten there, but how they bring investments in.

NASA needs congress to allocate money into its program. If no one supports them then they are going to get less money. For SpaceX and Blue Origin they require investors. If SpaceX crashes and does not make progress then investors stop putting money into it.

Beyond just ""doing"" how does SpaceX make going into space INTERESTING? They have gotten people to watch it. They've tapped into reality television without the bullshit (think Big Brother) and made it pure. There are camera's on board. There are live tweeting events. There are announcements on the news. There is LIVE streaming. 

Here is one of the most dangerous and daunting ventures and they LIVE STREAM it. Let's watch as this rocket blasts off, flies up, through the atmosphere, into space, stages break off, the orbiter continues onwards, and then the first stage booster lands on a barge. All of this happening live. On TV. On the Internet. While being tweeted about. While the world watches.

Would half as many people care that SpaceX launched a rocket if it was not live streamed? Would as many people care if they only got to see a picture of the rocket on the platform (Did it even take off the conspiracy theorists scream!)? No. 

The interest comes from the way that SpaceX brings the exploration right to the viewer."

Has you probably know, SpaceX Had planned to send a Red Dragon on mars in 2018, and more recently, Elon musk said that he want people on mars by 2024. And to do so, he want to use every mars launch windows before the ultimate manned landing to launch cargo.

well I think you all see where I'm going here : everything seems pretty similar to me.

I want to add that the concepts and sketch of Mars One always showed a a colony of dragon capsule...

so there it is, Is it possible that the first Martian could be those from Mars one sent on mars by spaceX ?"

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/10/elon-musk-provides-new-details-on-his-mind-blowing-mission-to-mars/  
  
  
New information regarding the SpaceX's Mars plans  
  
- Maiden voyage in 2022 will carry lots of science equipment and rovers either build by SpaceX or other companies.  
  
- Early flights will help test SpaceX's landing capabilities as well as navigation to Mars. Lots and lots of important data will be gathered.  
  
- SpaceX will be launching crafts regularly to Mars that scientists and engineers around the world can count on. This means tons and tons of new science will be done on Mars by people around the world.  
  
>“Essentially what we’re saying is we’re establishing a cargo route to Mars,” he said. “It’s a regular cargo route. You can count on it. It’s going happen every 26 months. Like a train leaving the station. And if scientists around the world know that they can count on that, and it’s going to be inexpensive, relatively speaking compared to anything in the past, then they will plan accordingly and come up with a lot of great experiments.”  
 
  
- In 2020 they will fly two Falcon Heavy rockets filled up with experiments to Mars.  
  
- Musk says the craft will be ""Really really big""  ""Mindblowingly big"" Musk cant wait to talk about it this September at IAC  
  
- Next mission in 2024 will have a small crew.  
  
 A final quote from Musk:  
  
>“It’s dangerous and probably people will die—and they’ll know that,” he continued. “And then they’ll pave the way, and ultimately it will be very safe to go to Mars, and it will very comfortable. But that will be many years in the future.”  
  

  
Some questions:  
  
- Is it really feasible that they will launch the worlds biggest rocket hauling the worlds biggest 2nd stage capsule within 5 years? What about it being human rated?    
  
- If so, how far along in the process do you think they are right now?

For sure, if those factory will ever exist, it will be churning out something that is generalized in the future space industry. I guess the final products will be rocket engines (Raptor sized, Merlin sized and Draco sized) because they will be everywhere. It will be vertically integrated, which means a lot shorten of supply chain. And the engine test will be automated compare to what they are doing right now. And of course, its gonna be big.

Please comment."

September 2, 6:45pm EDT

SpaceX has begun the careful and deliberate process of understanding the causes and fixes for yesterday's incident.  We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress and findings, to the fullest extent we can share publicly.

We deeply regret the loss of AMOS-6, and safely and reliably returning to flight to meet the demands of our customers is our chief priority.  SpaceX's business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion.  In the aftermath of yesterday's events, we are grateful for the continued support and unwavering confidence that our commercial customers as well as NASA and the United States Air Force have placed in us.

Overview of the incident:

- Yesterday, at SpaceX's Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, an anomaly took place about eight minutes in advance of a scheduled test firing of a Falcon 9 rocket.

- The anomaly on the pad resulted in the loss of the vehicle.

- This was part of a standard pre-launch static fire to demonstrate the health of the vehicle prior to an eventual launch. 

- At the time of the loss, the launch vehicle was vertical and in the process of being fueled for the test.  At this time, the data indicates the anomaly originated around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank.  Per standard operating procedure, all personnel were clear of the pad.  There were no injuries.

To identify the root cause of the anomaly, SpaceX began its investigation immediately after the loss, consistent with accident investigation plans prepared for such a contingency.  These plans include the preservation of all possible evidence and the assembly of an Accident Investigation Team, with oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and participation by NASA, the United States Air Force and other industry experts.  We are currently in the early process of reviewing approximately 3000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a time period of just 35-55 milliseconds. 

As for the Launch Pad itself, our teams are now investigating the status of SLC-40.  The pad clearly incurred damage, but the scope has yet to be fully determined.  We will share more data as it becomes available.  SpaceX currently operates 3 launch pads – 2 in Florida and 1 in California at Vandenberg Air Force Base.  SpaceX's other launch sites were not affected by yesterday's events.  Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base is in the final stages of an operational upgrade and Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center remains on schedule to be operational in November.  Both pads are capable of supporting Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.  We are confident the two launch pads can support our return to flight and fulfill our upcoming manifest needs.

Again, our number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue.

As some have pointed out Scot manly was incorrect about the filling area. A lot of people are talking about struts and tanks. I'd like to give another possible cause. 

[here](http://i.imgur.com/WYDCr6u.png) is Scott manlys X.  [here](http://i.imgur.com/vacV6At.png) is one frame later. 

It does look like it's coming out of the side of f9. But also note that we aren't looking straight on at it or the strong back. 

This got me thinking we may not be seeing all of the explosion. So I looked at the [damage](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pad40_amos6_damage2.jpg) photos. 

Looking at the location of the damage you will in fact see the strong back has a large series of [pumps](http://blogs.nasa.gov/kennedy/wp-content/uploads/sites/246/2016/01/JASON3_Rollout.jpg) at almost that exact location. 

Something that furthers my beliefs the strong back failing is this:

Dewar have the video in slow motion and you will note that the payload did not pull the strong back down. it can be seen suspended and falling only after the strong back collapses. 

http://i.imgur.com/dw2wmKx.png
http://i.imgur.com/aaS2bd1.png

(It's easier to see in the video)

So I suspect that a pump on the strong back failed sending shrapnel into f9. "

A little background, I'm an Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering student from Purdue who's a team member for Purdue's Human Mars Architecture project. I have a decently extensive knowledge of the mission at hand, but obviously not everything, so if you know I'm off on something, please be critical. I want more than anything to start a constructive conversation on the mission.

I previously wrote this comment on the post about Musk's presentation. Any commentary would be appreciated.

> Well the main thing that threw us off was the universality of the ""spaceship"". And there are a lot of question marks about it. 

> first off, this thing is absolutely massive. A 200 person ship filled with recreational activities and a restaurant? Talk about an obscene amount of mass that needs to leave Earth in one launch. I'm very critical on if you can have single launch stage that propels that thing to orbit to start. Their numbers for thrust and everything else are nice and large but are they realistic to the real world?

> this ship is also being used Earth-Mars transfer vehicle, Mars EDL (Entry, descent, landing) vehicle, Mars ascent vehicle, and the return vehicle. That is absolutely unheard of. Most Mars architectures have some combo of a vehicle for the orbit transfer, an EDL vehicle, a Martian ascent vehicle, and an Earth return vehicle. (Depending on the architecture you look at some of these may be used for a couple of purposes.) These different vehicles are tremendously different because they need to do different things, and Musk wants one vehicle that does all of them, and lasts 1000 missions. Really?

> EDL on a Martian surface is a very tricky issue, especially when you have humans in the ship. There are a lot of variables that work against us on it. You add another huge variable when you're trying to slow down a ship that big. That thing has an incredible amount of inertia, and slowing it down won't be easy.

> Then comes the heavy reliance on their controlled landing first stage.

> I get that it's been tested and they've had success with it, but they're thrown an incredible bet that it will continue to keep working exactly like it should. This is spaceflight; things rarely ever go perfectly according to plan. What happens if it misses, the return fails and the stage is destroyed, or it destroys that magnificent crane mechanism it's supposed to land right next to? You have a ship full of 100-200 souls sitting in limbo, and I'd venture a bet that returning something with its full amount of crew and payload back to Earth would be an incredibly difficult task. 

> Then there's the human factors. That's a ship full of people who can't go outside (generally speaking, I'm gonna guess they can do EVAs but that's not necessarily a calm walk in the park). All they know for those 6 or so months are what's there. People don't always get along, and what happens if they don't there? People can get cabin fever, they can form up against each other, they can do any number of things when sanity goes, and I'm not sure if they've done to proper studies or research to see how people might react in situations like this. We've done a lot of research into the optimal number of people for a mission, and I'm not too sure they have. 

> The one that erks me the most is the overlooking of certain important variables. When asked about radiation, Musk shrugged it off like it wasn't a big deal. I'm working on radiation shielding for Purdue Human Journey to Mars, and that really pissed me off. Space radiation is an incredibly important aspect, to that point that a few studies have called it the limiting factor of human exploration. Carbon fiber, which is what he wants to make this out of, has very little shielding effect. If you don't have to proper shielding and detection and you get hit with a solar particle event that's strong enough, that's it. End of story. It can deliver a dose of radiation 100x greater than a lifetime radiation intake in less than a day. And to just say it's not an issue is infuriating. 

> Those are just a few off the top of my head as I'm sitting in the computer lab taking a break from hw. 

> To give a comparison of the magnitude of a single launch mission, think about Apollo 11. One Saturn V launched a crew of 3 people with an orbit transfer vehicle and a lander which doubled as a lunar ascent vehicle. These are tiny vehicles with little space and only the necessary amenities for the trip. We used a Saturn V which is a massive fucking rocket to accomplish that little amount. The Saturn V is bigger and more powerful than any rocket in use today by a lot. The necessary launch vehicle for this proposed mission would make the V look like a toy you buy at Walmart. I can't even begin to conceive that

Everything I have read has been certain that artificial gravity is a must if we want astronauts to reach the planet and still be able to perform manual task, (astronauts coming back from the ISS can barely stand despite exercising for many hours a day). I talked to Andy Wier (author of The Martian) and he agreed that AG was a must have.

I read that Musk thinks this is not a problem and is reversible if they can cut the journey time, so I was wondering if it really is feasable to get humans to Mars without artificial gravity, and still be strong enough to perform research? I understand that Spacex is aimed at creating a colony not a research mission, but the astronauts would still need to be able to function well. 

I know many people think that you need a huge spinning ship to create the gravity, and this would be far too expensive, however Andy Weir advised that we use a central hub with pods attached using long cables, allowing the ship to spin slowly while still creating 1g of force, whilst also avoiding the large costs of constructing a spinning 'wheel' with a huge radius."

First, congrats to all at SpaceX for an amazing launch and perfect recovery. From what I understand, today's launch took place from Vandenberg Air Force Base (on the west coast) and landed on a drone barge off of the west coast, so at least for the initial phase at least the rocket must have been traveling retrograde (against the Earth's rotation). Iridium satellites currently in orbit have an altitude of about 781 km and an inclination of 86.4 degrees, so they must travel prograde (with the Earth's rotation, since inclination is less than 90 degrees). All I can find online about Iridium 1's final orbit is that it is ""polar"" (about 90 degrees inclination, could still be retrograde or prograde). Since all satellites currently in the Iridium constellation travel prograde in order to maintain overlapping coverage, does this mean that Iridium 1 will perform a plane change maneuver to go prograde? The deltaV cost, and thus the propellant cost, would make this seem doubtful. Does anyone know what the orbital parameters for the final orbit of Iridium 1 are?"

Ok with that out of the way, I dont understand why SpaceX, probably the biggest manufacturer of spacecrafts right now is preferring to invent in the field rockets instead of space shuttles.
A space shuttle should be easier to use as a vehicle, should be cheaper to go in orbit although it would take more time. 
If SpaceX philosophy was to put satellites to space than I would be fine with them creating rockets to deliver satellites to space, but Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars, and a shuttle would be more suitable for that job and it could as well carry satellites to space and than land easily on earth like a plain would.
Although now that I right this post I figured it out !
They begin by building rockets and than apply all their knowledge to building a shuttle with those rocket they have developed.
Its fascinating and the era we live in is pretty awesome I have to admit !
I really want them to succeed and work with NASA for a better Astronomical future !"

He states though the tanker will not be able to land, presumably because of insufficient reserve fuel. Then it could be an expendable SSTO:

 Here's a simulation of the ITS upper stage tanker as an SSTO:

 It suggests it can get a total mass of 190 metric tons to LEO as an expendable. Since the dry mass is 90 metric tons, this means a 100 metric ton payload to orbit.

In late February this year the news was going crazy over the announcement Elon Musk made about two private citizens who payed a significant deposit to have SpaceX send them on a mission around the moon by late 2018 (likely November or December) on a Dragon Crew atop a Falcon Heavy.

From what I know the Dragon Crew (also known as Dragon version 2) is slated for an unmanned test flight to the ISS late this year flowed by the first ISS commercial crew flights taking place early to mid 2018. Falcon Heavy is due to launch in the summer of this year hopefully if there are no more accidents with the Falcon 9 rocket which the Falcon heavy depends on three of them & if Falcon 9 is grounded because of accidents it would delay the Falcon heavy demo flight.

The Falcon Heavy was originally announced to be launching by 2013 but delays with Falcon 9 & the lack of need for a Falcon heavy pushed Falcon Heavy's maiden flight to summer this year. There are at least 9 planned falcon 9 launches between now & Falcon Heavy's first flight so that's 9 chances Falcon 9 could be grounded should an accident happen during a Falcon 9 launch between now & then. I predict this mission could be delayed by as late as 2019 to 2020 also delaying Red Dragon which is also moved from 2018 to 2020.

Little is known about the paying tourists other than they know each other well & are very rich (most likely billionaires) & are interested in space enough to take this very bold risky mission which would be the second or 3rd Falcon Heavy flight & Crew Dragons 3rd or 4th flight (2nd flight with passengers & Falcon Heavy's 1st manned flight) Musk also seems to think highly enough of them saying they will be going with the hopes & dreams  of all humankind & driven by the human spirit of exploration like the Apollo astronauts before them. They are supposed to do medical tests soon this year followed by mission training later this year. Little training would be required as the whole flight will be on autopilot making training necessary only for emergency procedures. "

SpaceX has been operating as a company serving clients for some years now

Blue Origin has served zero clients and he has not even put a payload into orbit. All their hardware is still in experimental stages.

Bezos in the past got the TV news program 60 Minutes to basically run a prime time ad for Amazon by sticking an Amazon logo on a drone and saying they'd use drones one day.

So is that what he is doing right now? 

Influencing news outlets to portray his space company as being on the same level as others while they play catch-up?

Is there something I'm missing when it comes to Blue Origin's achievements or current state of hardware?

SpaceX gained a lot of attention over time through meaningful achievements. 

But I'm very confused as to why so many news sites compare these two companies as direct rivals when SpaceX's actual current competition would a something like ULA that actually has rockets that are vying for contracts."

* Launching fuel **after** launching the people

Why? Just to give people more time to vomit or opt out? They are going to spend months in transit so why give them extra time to enjoy the view? And if the fuel goes pop on the way up, the people would have taken a risk going up just to go straight back down again, another risk. I think fuel should definatly go first.

* All in one vehicle

Jack of all trades, master of none. Wouldnt 3 specialized vehicles be better? Especially having a deep space transport with more space, more comforts, adapted radiation shielding, adapted for zero-G, non-aerodynamic, non-atmospheric flight.

Big solar panels that extend and retract adds complexity where simplicity is desired. Ascent/descent vehicles would be more suitable running off batteries and generators.

I assume Mars ascent/descent is quite different from Earth, so why use the exact same design for both?

Or even connecting the passenger vehicle with an Earth-Mars transfer module with the solar panels and extra habitat space to make the trip less cramped."

Apologies as there are a few voices in the vid from the people around.


This was taken by me today at the Launch (From the LC-39 Area)- I figured some of you guys might like this- As Infrared pictures/Videos  of Rockets are hyper-rare.

I strongly suspect the Rocket in the Launch Video, at 1:30 was undergoing the Coriolis effect- it started drifting to the side slowly after it got high- and I could not figure out why- until I realized at that altitude, it was straight compared to the earth underneath moving.

Typically with my camera I can watch rocket launches for minutes after they disappear from view to the naked eye , but this time I lost it at MECO. (I would go on to reacquire it when it came down.)
(The Prior launch I was able to watch the Atlas-5 (OA-7) for longer than 2 minutes after it disappeared from eyesight from the Cape, just with my thermal camera. 

In the Landing Video- aside from the beginning of the video and the end, you can catch a glimpse at the minute mark, where it shortly appears in the clouds. While I can see the rocket through clouds during Launch- with only  one engine lit during the landing, it doesn't necessarily shine through the warm clouds - which were a bit thick.

Last weekend SpaceX launched BulgariaSat-1 from SLC-39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida and Iridium NEXT Mission 2 from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

BulgariaSat-1 mission flew with aluminum grid fins (with coating to protect them as much as possible), as had every previous mission with the intent of attempting a landing of the 1st stage of the rocket.  This landing was considered very difficult:

>Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/878313692986621953

The first stage did land successfully and was brought back into Port Canaveral yesterday.  It was noted by a user when he was looking through his pictures that one of the grid fins for the BulgariaSat-1 first stage was damaged (as you can see clearly in the pictures).

Iridium-2 flew with the new titanium grid fins and landed successfully, despite heavy seas at the time of landing.  The forces on it were not as intense but I think the result is clear from the pictures.

From Elon himself:

>Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/878821062326198272

>Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/878821062326198272

>New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.

Specifically,  at what time does the rocket pitch over at an angle to gain horizontal speed for orbit, and what is the pitch angle?

Since the SpaceX launch video has the time, speed, and altitude, my expectation was that I could determine the distance traveled, compare this to the altitude, and see how much of the distance was vertical versus horizontal. But this doesn't work out.

For example, at T+1:48 in the OTV-5 video([link](https://youtu.be/9M6Zvi-fFv4?t=14m48s)), speed is 2828 km/h and altitude is 28.1km. At T+1:49 (30 frames later), speed is 2895 km/h and altitude is 28.9 km. During this second the distance traveled is the average speed * 1 second: Δd = 2861.5 km/h / 3600sec/hour = 0.8 km. From the video, the altitude increased 28.9-28.1 = 0.8km. Since these are the same, the rocket's travel must have been entirely vertical. If the rocket were traveling at, say, a 45° angle to vertical, the altitude increase would have been just cos(45°)*0.8km = 0.57km.

I checked a dozen points during the launch and the calculated distance traveled always matches the reported altitude increase. My expectation was that shortly after launch, the altitude increase would drop off indicating the rocket had pitched over. So did I mess up basic physics? Is the rocket pitch very small? Is the video reporting distance and calling it altitude?"

I mean if I would assume that 2 burns, 1 to suborbital and 1 to land, would use a whole lot of propellant rather than a 14 hour slow 'burn' of fuel in a plane

It got me thinking that maybe the electric car idea wasn't developed for environmental impact solely which I assumed but as a literal cheaper alternative to fuel therefore a good product to try to make popular and make lots of money. 

I'm all for new developments, the engineering feats of the last few years awesome and I want to see this prosper, but if you replace even 15% of commercial flights to rockets (didnt actually calculate anything), that sounds kind of polluting if you ask me."

[New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard) was the first rocket to land after having gone to space.  It happened on November, the 23rd 2015.  SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 first stage about a month later.  Before that, SpaceX had landed its GrassHopper test vehicle, but that vehicle did not reach space, and did not recover from a terminal velocity fall.  In that sense, Grasshopper is similar to previous experiments such as [DC-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X).

**REUSABLE FROM THE START**

BO only launched New Sheppard five times, but *it used the same unique vehicle every time*.  By comparison, SpaceX only actually re-used a first stage in march 2017, during [SES-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES-10) mission.  This rocket flew for the first time for the [CRS-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-8) mission, almost a year earlier.  Very little is known about the cost and/or extent of the refurbishment that was necessary.  Basically, despite re-usability being advertised as SpaceX main strategy for reducing costs, they do build many rockets, their re-usage being the exception rather than the rule.  By contrast, BO is so focused on re-usability that they only built *one* rocket.

**MORE SENSIBLE LONG-TERM STRATEGY**

BO wants to have humans work and live in space, in order to lower the environmental burden of human activities on Earth.  They have the financial support of their founder, Jeff Bezos, literally the richest man in the world, who can afford to spend a billion dollars a year in this venture.

SpaceX has long claimed that they want to save mankind from Armageddon by building ""a self-sustaining city on mars"".   Recently, Elon Musk changed his justification discourse by stating that the goal is to ""inspire people with technology"".  He also only recently proposed an actual business plan to finance his mars ambitions.  This plan seems to include a suborbital Earth-to-Earth transport service, which has been received with a high level of skepticism in the aerospace community.

**ENGINES**

Rocket engines are a crucial part of a launcher.  SpaceX future launchers will depend on the Raptor engine, which has, as of today, still never been tested at full-scale.

BO has built several of its BE-4 engines, and tests are currently underway.  At least one of them has been publicly documented.  It was a full-scale test, albeit not full-throttle nor duration.

**ORBITS ARE OVER-RATED**

BO has never flown a spacecraft to orbit, but orbital flights is something that has been done for decades now.  It is not what SpaceX and BO origin want to be recognized for.  Their goal is re-usability.  Had SpaceX not been able to re-use one of its first stages, it would just had been yet-an-other new aerospace company (like say, [orbital sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Corporation) and their Antares launcher).

**CONCLUSION**

For these reasons, I believe Blue Origin is actually more advanced than SpaceX in its goal of lowering access to space with rocket re-usability, and I'm more excited for the developments of BO than SpaceX."

I think the best one was from La Jolla.

I will try to find the link.

Of course stage one can be seen puffing easily as well.


Edit: i think it was this one   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GiYEO9gYsGo

Although this one had fhe moon absolutely perfectly positioned behind it atthat moment for best backlighting at 4 k. It might have been this one https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpai1OPDw1o

**SpaceX and customers defend Falcon 9 performance after Zuma mission
by Jeff Foust — January 17, 201
Space News**

SpaceX reiterated at a congressional hearing Jan. 17 that its Falcon 9 rocket performed as expected on its most recent launch, despite swirling questions about the potential failure of the classified Zuma mission.

SpaceX, though, now has the support of the customer for its next commercial launch, who said it was “confident” that SpaceX would be ready for the late January mission.

In a tweet Jan. 17, SES said it reviewed data from the Jan. 7 Falcon 9 launch of Zuma and concluded that the vehicle had performed as expected, clearing the way for the launch of GovSat-1, a joint venture of SES and the government of Luxembourg, on another Falcon 9 currently scheduled for Jan. 30.

“Following Zuma mission, our engineering staff have reviewed all relevant launch vehicle flight data following last Falcon-9 launcher mission,” the company tweeted. “We are confident on SpaceX readiness & set for Govsat-1 launch late Jan!”

The comment by SES came several hours after a SpaceX executive defended the vehicle’s performance in response to questions by members of the House space subcommittee during a hearing on NASA’s commercial crew program, for which SpaceX is one of two companies developing vehicles.

Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), chairman of the subcommittee, raised the issue of the status of the Zuma mission in the first question after opening statements. Babin noted he was restricted in what could be discussed during a public, unclassified hearing, “but circumstances surrounding this mission do have a direct impact on NASA and this committee’s jurisdiction and oversight responsibilities.”

“Falcon 9 performed as specified. It actually performed very well,” said Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX. “We’re picking up the launches by the end of the month, as we planned.”

Actions by Falcon 9 customers appear to support the assessment that the launch went according to plan. In addition to the SES statement, Space Systems Loral announced Jan. 16 that it had shipped the Hispasat 30W-6 spacecraft, which it built for satellite operator Hispasat, to Cape Canaveral for launch on a Falcon 9. That launch is expected in mid-February. 

SES announced Jan. 11 that GovSat-1, built by Orbital ATK, had arrived at Cape Canaveral for its upcoming launch. Industry officials say it’s unlikely the operators would agree to ship the satellites to the launch site if they believed that their upcoming launches were in danger of being delayed because of any investigation into the Zuma mission.

Other customers have stood behind SpaceX. In a series of tweets Jan. 11, Matt Desch, chief executive of Iridium, said he believed that SpaceX was not responsible for any failure of the Zuma mission, and criticized media coverage of the launch. SpaceX has successfully launched 40 of Iridium’s next-generation satellites on four Falcon 9 missions, with four more launches scheduled for 2018 to launch the remaining 35.

“I believe SpaceX statements, and have my own beliefs about what probably happened,” he wrote in one tweet. “Just find it sloppy and lazy to blame SpaceX when others more likely at fault (but won’t/can’t talk).”

When the scenery is sufficiently lacking in bright objects, it is occasionally possible to spot the telltale white specks and streaks.

Do we think that this is what space colonization will be? And if it is, SpaceX seems to be giving us a much cheaper ride on bigger ships across the ocean. I suppose the ISS is Jamestown :)

I'd love to hear why you think this is or isn't a good analogy and why. And what do you think will come next?

And within the decade we'll hopefully see a truly reusable BFR start to fly.

But as revolutionary as these spacecraft designs are, they are still spacecraft which are assembled entirely on Earth. Even the BFS, which is meant to be fueled in orbit, still has to be assembled and launched in its entirety on the surface of the Earth. This puts an upper limit on the size of spacecraft we can launch, because we can't just keep endlessly strapping boosters to bigger and bigger payloads.

The next step after fully reusable surface-to-orbit (STO) rockets is obviously using STO rockets to launch *spacecraft components* into orbit and then assembling larger spacecraft there.

How long do you think it'll take until someone successfully launches this kind of spacecraft, and what form will it take?"

I will be doing a few things on the side to sweeten up my resume(interning at Spacex, pilots license, scuba diving certificate, level 3 rockets license and putting a rocket above 100k feet, officially discovering an asteroid(I'm an amateur astronomer, it's easier than it sounds but still challenging), attending possum academy, etc.) 

I am in love with Spacex and all of Elon's companies. I find him very inspiring and would one day want to work at the HQ in Hawthorne. He's obviously announced BFR and showed some progress just recently, but hasn't covered on how to apply for an astronaut position. I know he wants to colonize mars with millions but I want to be one of the first if not THE FIRST. He hasn't fully predicted when BFR will realistically be ready for its first cargo mission. I realize that becoming an astronaut includes extremely tough competition, so I've always wanted to get his attention and stand out from the others(hence a few of the things I stated above). I know this sounds crazy but I've even considered actually writing him a professional letter and mailing it to his actual house. I know his address(don't ask, not a creep). Elon seems to attract to the outsiders so I figured it would put me a step ahead of the others. 

Thanks for the help,
Nick"

Both could hire  people. Blue Origin has had more money for several years than Spacex used to make Flacon 9. Blue Origin has a good engine.

Why didnt New Glenn happen last year?

The only real difference between the companies is Elon.

If Elon had had a billion a year for the past 4 years we would probably have BFR on several round trips to Mars already

In which I assert that it's entirely possible to continually send cargo upwards on a space elevator, that doing so would not cause a slowdown in the orbit of the counterweight and of the whole system, and any orbital energy gained by a payload from climbing the elevator does not come at the expense of the balance of the whole system, but in a well designed elevator where the center of mass is beyond GEO (geosynchronous orbit) the energy will be restored by centrifugal force from the earth's rotation. 


&nbsp;

**Please feel free to contribute to our discussion!**

EDIT: The argument against-

>If you send mass up the elevator, it will drag on the line, which will pull back on the attached station(s) and counterweight, slowing them down. The up-going cargo is having kinetic energy added to it parasitically, by stealing it from the rest of the beanstalk. Sending cargo down from orbit would achieve the reverse result. That kinetic energy has to come from(or go to) somewhere.

>The only way this would balance out is for you to send equal amounts of cargo down-line, matched to what is going out-line. Not sure how closely in time you'd have to achieve this matching without creating destructive harmonics/whipsawing.

>Or, short of that, you would need thrusters on the station and counterweight, adding or subtracting velocity to the assemblage(very carefully done to avoid destructive harmonics AKA Tacoma Narrows Bridge) to make up for any shortfalls due to incoming/outgoing cargo mass imbalance.

&nbsp;

And

&nbsp;
>No beanstalk is going to work with the earth tugging on it like it's cracking the whip. That will cause failure - due to the beanstalk acquiring harmonics that tear it apart, or due to simple overload failure. The entire system needs to be assembled with the station and counterweight more or less in place, in a stable orbit, and then the initial beanstalk strand lowered to the surface of the Earth and captured(while extending the matching beanstalk out to the counterweight at the same time). Balance is key.

>The entire system needs to be maintained in balance. You can't allow the earth to ""crack the whip"". That would destroy the beanstalk, either through destructive harmonics, or stress-induced failure. Most theoretical beanstalks are just barely able to survive simply carrying the weight of the line itself and a fully loaded cargo elevator. None would work with some kind of wind-up whip-cracking function transferring kinetic energy from the earth to the station & counterweight. The station is essentially in geosynch orbit, and requires no ""whip-cracking"" restraint via the line from the earth. The counterweight is there to ensure that the weight of the line doesn't pull the station out of its very carefully maintained geosynch positioning. It's all about balance. Very carefully maintained balance.

>Also, even assuming you were allowed to put cargo up and down the beanstalk in some uncontrolled manner in the first place, a cargo elevator ascending will be acquiring kinetic energy via the beanstalk, initially in small amounts at the lower end, and increasing as the angular rotation increases towards the station end of the beanstalk. So assuming you were to allow this kind of uncontrolled parasitic energy sap from the system, the bulk of the energy imparted to the elevator would come near the station end of the beanstalk, and thus pull mostly from the station/counterweight. Which would cause a slowdown of the station & counterweight, causing them to lag behind in their orbit, pulling them back and down, and potentially deorbiting the station, counterweight, and beanstalk.

>Like winding a length of monofilament onto the hub of a weed whacker - unless you do something to either balance the cargo going up and down the line, or adding thrust directly to the station and counterweight, you are going to have a catastrophic failure.

&nbsp;

My last comment: 
>Any sane elevator design extends way past geosynchronous, such as the one on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) or in this [WPI paper](https://users.wpi.edu/~paravind/Publications/PKASpace%20Elevators.pdf), since doing so avoids all of the problems you describe. In fact, not only is the counterweight well above geosynchronous, the center of mass of the [whole system has to be](http://gassend.net/spaceelevator/center-of-mass/index.html). 

>You would not have any whip-cracking if the center of mass were in a much higher orbit than geosynchronous, as any force pulling the counterweight down is quickly opposed by the centrifugal force. The special point of geosynchronous is where the speed of the orbit is matched by the speed of the earth's rotation, and beyond which anything on the tether would feel a net outward force. See the last paragraph in [this section] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator#Apparent_gravitational_field).

>You might, as the first reply said, have some oscillation, around the original height of the counterweight, but this can be managed, along with pendulum-like oscillations. All of these oscillations [are stable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009457650800338X?via%3Dihub) (as opposed to unstable, where small perturbations lead to the whole system collapsing). 


>In fact, the weed whacker is a perfect example of why this works: you can easily send ""cargo"" from the surface of the weed whacker hub along any filament attached to it and it will be flung out at extreme speeds. When you ""crack the whip"", the filament doesn't fall down. It will rapidly return to a taut position. The space elevator uses the same concept to allow us to easily get payload to orbit, having only to pay the gravitational cost of lifting mass and letting us ""steal"" the earth's rotational energy to put towards orbital energy.

Eversince beeing a child I loved space and space travel. And spaceX increased this interest even more. About a year ago I started watching videos on YouTube but it feels like I've watched everything available, which is obviously not true. Here's a list of my favorite channels:

* [Scott Manley](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg)
* [Joe Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/jnightandday)
* [Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uKrU_WqJ1R2HMTY3LIx5Q)

* [Skyships Eng](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt-xRCZqNAOCxPUh_kXymNQ)

Last week I ordered two new books:

* Failure Is Not an Option \[Gene Kranz\]
* Ignition!: An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants \[John Drury Clark\]

Now it's time for my question. Are there some YouTube channels, books, websites or movies out there that you absolutely love and would recommend to me to ~~waste more time~~ learn new things? Thanks!"

"8","2018-07-26","NASA, SLS, BFR, and SpaceX's Mars Mission- the silence is deafening","As a prelude, I recognize that NASA has accomplished great things in the past, and even now makes great contributions to a variety of things besides manned space travel and launch systems.

A year ago, BFR was a little more than a paper rocket, but nowadays with an entire factory being built just to produce BFR's and a prototype that will undergo grasshopper testing in a matter of months being constructed, NASA's silence is deafening. People far smarter than me have already torn apart NASA's ""state of the art"" space launch system, but to summarize it would be 1-2 billion dollars vs 10 million or less for the BFR, would launch at a MAX cadence of 1-2 per year, would carry less than the BFR, and is in no way expendable. In literally every way it is inferior. While BFR does not exist yet, SLS is practically obsolete just with FH. Where SpaceX is developing the rocket of the future for hundreds of millions, NASA has spent almost 50 billion dollar on a useless outdated rocket and hasn't even bothered designing payloads. Congress shares some of the blame for redirecting NASA's priorities every few years but even then the mismanagement has been stunning. The fact that no new SLS updates have come out in months, and NASA has been silent on the BFR, speaks volumes on just how embarrassing it is for all of NASA, and just how far the SLS is from even existing. This year, just like the James Webb Space Telescope, it has been delayed at a faster pace than it has progressed. NASA is spending almost 3 billion dollars a year developing the SLS and Orion, both of which have practically already been made obsolete, while SpaceX is accomplishing leagues more with a budget nowhere near that size.

Furthermore, while SpaceX has been pushing ahead preparing for the allegedly 2024 Mars Mission, with activities including hiring spacesuit sewers and designers and creating an in-house R&D department focused on propellant production, NASA has been entirely silent about both their ""mission"" to mars and SpaceX as a whole. NASA has no concrete plans whatsoever for going back to mars besides developing this obsolete and ridiculously expensive launcher, testing it less than once a year, and maybe sometime in the late 2020's (which we all know will be delayed by years) launch a ""deep space gateway"" that is basically a smaller, more expensive ISS around the moon to... do what? It won't help research in a way the ISS hasn't, it won't help exploration of the moon any more than a base could. While NASA proclaims it is the next step to facilitating space travel, as of right now, backed by criticism from former NASA astronauts, entirely useless and another drain on the budget.

In reality, budget shows that with the SLS, NASA will literally be incapable of going to mars, and all without even designing concepts for landers, bases, or anything that would be more than a symbolic flag and footprints. While many in [r/space](https://old.reddit.com/r/space) moan about NASA's budget, if NASA pisses billions of dollars away on obsolete tech and makes bullshit arguments against why they can't use existing tech, I don't even think they deserve a higher budget for the SLS or Orion. While Elon has acknowledge that SpaceX will need to cooperate with NASA, NASA has made no offers to supply anything whatsoever to help the mission, whether astronauts, supplies, money, or anything of value.

At the end of the day, 2 billion dollars for a ship that launches once a year with practically NO work or research being done on landers or in space habitation besides the Orion crew capsule (a semi reusable capsule, that in traditional NASA fashion, costs orders of magnitude more than the Dragon) will not produce any mission to anywhere. I am not confident that NASA will conduct a manned mission to anywhere in the solar system this century unless they start cooperating with SpaceX. Politicians in and out of NASA always talk about returning to the moon or mars in ""10 or 20 years"" but it is clear that without SpaceX, none of these missions would ever be happening from American soil. What makes me the most sad is that NASA has trained hundreds of astronauts, many who dream of going to space and walking among the planets of the Solar System, and the internal bureaucracy is so controlled by the whims of pork barrel senators and making such pathetic efforts to truly make space cheaper or take advantage of the reduction in launch prices across the board that I think that if they stick with NASA, many of them will not even enter space.

NASA leadership, and anyone really interested in American space travel, needs to stop ignoring this elephant in the room. SpaceX will go to Mars, faster with NASA but also without NASA. As of right now, all of the budget reports and delays are screaming that unless there is a dramatic restructuring, NASA will not be able to get to Mars in the next 30-40 years."

[ 1983 untitled painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat. ](https://i.redd.it/ns6uivlwb3n11.jpg)

 

So today (9/18/2018) Elon Musk's SpaceX released the name of the [first Space Tourist](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/18/technology/yusaku-maezawa-spacex/index.html), Yusaku Maezawa. This will be the first manned flight around the moon since the Apollo Missions.  Maezawa, [a Japanese Billionaire who made his fortune in the music and fashion industry,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa) didn't just buy one seat on the “Big Falcon Rocket” (BFR). He bought 9 tickets! The other 8 tickets he is [giving to artists from different countries](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17872822/yusaku-maezawa-spacex-dear-moon-artists-roundtable-culture) free of charge hoping to inspire them to create their next master piece. Maezawa has a deep love for art, which made news in 2017 when he paid a jaw dropping $110 million for an 1983 untitled painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat. (This one - [https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/embargo-830am-1-11-yusaku-maezawas-blockbuster-basquiat-gets-show-brooklyn-museum-1194494](https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/embargo-830am-1-11-yusaku-maezawas-blockbuster-basquiat-gets-show-brooklyn-museum-1194494) ). 

Last week, Sept. 14th, Hulu premiered their latest original series “[The First](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7412482/?ref_=rlm).” Which is a sci-fi space drama about visiting and eventually colonizing the planet Mars. Just like SpaceX is promoting. (I'm only 4 episodes in because I don't have time to binge it). Filming for the show started in Sept. 2017. 

At the end of Episode 1, Natascha McElhone's character, Laz Ingram (who is CEO of the Commercial Space Flight Launch -- like Musk), is shown in her large modern home. Hanging over the fireplace is the exact portrait that Maezawa purchased 8 months prior. (Screenshot - [https://imgur.com/a/d7M1pf9](https://imgur.com/a/d7M1pf9) Time into episode 33:30).

&#x200B;

[Screenshot of Hulu Sci-Fi Series \\""The First\\""](https://i.redd.it/du9qg931c3n11.jpg)

This really shows the access that Hulu producers had to SpaceX, and how much attention to detail Hulu has given to the series.  

&#x200B;

TIMELINE: 

Jan. 2017 -  Yusaku Maezawa buys Jean-Michel Basquiat painting for $110m. 

Feb. 2017 - Musk announces ""Unnamed"" buyer purchased tickets to orbit the moon. 

Sept. 2017 - Filming begins on Hulu Original Series ""The First""

09/14/18 - ""The First Premiers"" with cut-scene showing Jean-Michel Basquiat painting

09/18/18 - SpaceX Announces Maezawa as buyer of the Moon Loop space orbit. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL/DR: In a 10 second cut-scene Hulu pre-shadowed a huge SpaceX announcement by 4 days. Which would have been known for almost an entire year. Showing a huge collaboration between the two companies. "

Just a thought. I know I'm probably not the first to have it, but there's a lot more of us who want to go to space one day than millionaires and if we wait for them to fund every thing we may wait a very long time."

**Perform the structural design of Dragon spacecraft for carrying cargo to and from ISS. The key specifications are as follows:**
1. The design of Dragon spacecraft can be based on SpaceX design or can be a modification.
2. The Dragon should be able to carry 6000kg of cargo to ISS with an internal volume of at least 14m3.
3. The maximum outer diameter of the Dragon should be 3.7 meter at the plane of attachment to launch vehicle.
4. The cargo space should be pressurized to atmospheric pressure.
5. The structure of the spacecraft can be made from any material or by using a combination of materials.
6. Structural members may be used to stiffen the structure.
7. The spacecraft would use thrusters for propulsion in space.
8. Acceleration and deceleration forces on the structure must be considered during load calculations.
9. The spacecraft design should be structurally safe for a return mission.
10. All strength calculations must be done using analytical methods. Use of finite element method is not allowed.
11. Thermal loads during re-entry in earth’s atmosphere should be considered in design.
12. Upon return to earth, the landing would be made in water by using parachutes.
13. Consider multiple load cases during the analysis that the spacecraft is expected to encounter during its mission.
**Design Objective**
The objective is to design a spacecraft with lowest possible weight and cost that is able to safely complete a return mission to ISS. Structural integrity of the spacecraft is of prime concern. Safe delivery of cargo must also be ensured.
**So how do I go about this? Also, if any other subreddits would be better equipped to answer this, please tell me what those are.**

[https://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2018/11/horizontal-landing-for-bfr-on-earth.html](https://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2018/11/horizontal-landing-for-bfr-on-earth.html)

and:

[https://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2017/10/spacex-bfr-tanker-as-ssto.html](https://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2017/10/spacex-bfr-tanker-as-ssto.html)

&#x200B;

The vertical landing method requiring large excess propellant *drastically* cuts into payload, in the range of a 40% cut(!) 

In contrast adding lightweight wings would only add minimally to the weight, and subtract minimally from the payload.

Have any questions to ask about the event? Post them here.

&nbsp;

At 07:49 UTC / 02:49 EST on March 2nd (tomorrow), SpaceX will launch their new Dragon 2 crew capsule (empty) to the International Space Station, aboard their Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is part of NASA's commercial crew program, a project where NASA funded two private companies (SpaceX and Boeing) to develop the ability to launch US astronauts into space, a capability America lost with the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.

As this is the first test there will be no astronauts onboard, instead there is [a dummy in a flightsuit, nicknamed 'Ripley'](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0ja-eBUwAEU4hL.jpg:large). The capsule will rendezvous with and dock with the International Space Station a day after launch.

-----------
-----------

**FAQs:**

**Why is this important?:**

This will be the first time an American capsule has been sent into orbit since the retirement of the space shuttle, and it will be a huge milestone for SpaceX. The hope is that commercial companies will soon be able to reliably send astronauts into space, and NASA will no longer have to pay Russia to send its crew to the ISS.

**When will SpaceX launch astronauts?:**

Assuming Demo Mission 1 is successful, SpaceX will then conduct an in-flight abort test, followed hopefully by the first launch of astronauts in July.

**Will SpaceX try to land and recover the rocket?:**

Yes, SpaceX will attempt to land the first stage of the Falcon 9 on an autonomous drone ship in the Atlantic

**How can I watch the launch?:**

SpaceX's coverage of launch events is excellent. Elon Musk has said on twitter that there will be live camera views from the dummy's perspective.

https://i.redd.it/9s801pmvepr21.jpg

The total cost for NASA to launch DART is approximately $69 million, which includes the launch service and other mission related costs.

The DART mission currently is targeted to launch in June 2021 on a Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. By using solar electric propulsion, DART will intercept the asteroid Didymos’ small moon in October 2022, when the asteroid will be within 11 million kilometers of Earth. "

Yesterday and today, the [Elon Musk](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) space company, [SpaceX](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/), has made headlines around the world for a successful new launch through [Falcon 9](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/).

It has been the third launch of this rocket, which has again successfully landed on its reuse, although in the process one of the two halves of its fairing has been lost.

Those responsible for the project have announced that they will try to recover it from the water in order to continue using it.

However, even if they failed, [SpaceX](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) will continue to give much to talk about in 2020, as it already has a large number of releases planned, some of the most curious.

This is the case that is scheduled for next March, when the company plans to take 480 hemp and coffee plant cell cultures to the International Space Station, in order to check what effects its growth in microgravity has and if its properties are modified, for later use, both in space and back on Earth.

It will be in charge of doing the CRS-20 cargo flight, backed by [SpaceCells](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) USA. Inc, Front Range Biosciences and the University of Colorado, as recently explained in a press release.

 

Experiments with sight in the future

The scientific evidence available so far suggests that plants in space can undergo numerous mutations.

This has led the researchers of the participating institutions to launch this project, whose objective is to verify to what extent they occur, how they affect them and if they remain once back on Earth.

The stay of these plant cells in space will last a month, after which [Front Range Biosciences](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) scientists will analyze whether there have been changes in [RNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/).

The objective of this test is to check if the gene expression they had before undergoing these extreme conditions has changed. But what does this mean exactly?

Remember that [DNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) is like the instruction book of an organism. All cells have the same code, but this is not read in the same way.

Depending on the function of each one, some instructions or others will be followed or, put in a more technical way, some genes or others will be expressed.

This is done through the conversion of [DNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) to another molecule, called [RNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/), which will later serve to synthesize the necessary proteins at all times.

In short, what these experts are looking for is to check if space changes the way in which plant cells read the instructions of the plant.

These experiments have the objective of verifying how plants would behave in space, facing future colonization, both for scientific purposes and, why not, also for tourism. They would be necessary as ornamentation, but especially to help space travelers stay healthy during their stay.

But that’s not all, because it is also intended to check if the stress of this new environment can help plants synthesize chemical compounds that they would not normally produce.

No doubt a very interesting research field will be opened as a result of this trip. Paint well the science that is presented for this 2020."

I don’t expect to get great seats due to our lack of planning; just a location where we can feel and hear the launch.

Thus far I’ve found a few other events in Port Canaveral however, since I’m not familiar with the area, we really don’t know what’s a good/bad site.

The new spacecraft used for this super mission will be called the Dragon XL and will surely be launched on a Falcon Heavy, or maybe can even be launched on Cargo form of Starship.

#**Mission details**


As the first crewed launch from US soil since 2011, this rocket launch will be one for the history books. Many years ago as the space shuttle was retired from service NASA contracted SpaceX to develop a crew-capable capsule as a sort of 'taxi service' to ferry NASA astronauts to the ISS. Their effort will come to fruition when astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken launch to the space station this week.

SpaceX has rapidly established itself as a major player in the rocket industry however it has yet to send people into space, so this is a crucial test for them. However the capsule design [flew successfully to the space station last year](https://youtu.be/2ZL0tbOZYhE) and NASA has high confidence that SpaceX will succeed, having certified the mission to move forward with launch preparations.

Their effort will come to fruition when astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken launch to the space station this weekend.

SpaceX has rapidly established itself as a major player in the rocket industry however it has yet to send people into space, so this is a crucial test for them. However the capsule design [flew successfully to the space station last year](https://youtu.be/2ZL0tbOZYhE) and NASA has high confidence that SpaceX will succeed, having certified the mission to move forward with launch preparations.

He also thinks that the starlink satellites are only for spying, and that commercial space industry is only good for billionaires and for us it's just another thing that's gonna destroy the planet because of rocket fuel consumption.

I tried to give him some arguments like:
- people are generally excited for all rocket launches these days, which is a good thing to be excited about no matter who does it.
- govt. Will spy on you if they want to doesn't matter the cost.
- rocket fuel consumption is incomparable to airline industry.

Can anyone please explain what expected LOS is and what causes it? I'm, having a very hard time finding any info on this common phenomenon, which I find bizarre. If anyone can point me to an educational resource, I'd greatly appreciate it.

It is referenced in this article: [https://www.universetoday.com/81763/more-images-details-on-spacexs-dragon-flight/amp/](https://www.universetoday.com/81763/more-images-details-on-spacexs-dragon-flight/amp/)

During the recent launch, there was an expected LOS just as/before the second stage separated. Signal from where to where? Why was it lost, why was it expected? And despite this signal being lost, Dragon was able to switch over to it's internal cameras, which, for some reason, their signal was not lost. What exactly is happening?

I'm asking because a friend I care dearly about has become a conspiracy theorist and for some reason he thinks that because we couldn't see the exact moment of stage 2 separation (which he predicted we wouldn't) this is evidence for at least part of this launch to be faked. I know it's insane, so I want to learn more about LOS and why some of the signals can overcome it and some can't, and why it happens. Thanks!"

LUVOIR is already expected to be too large to launch on any rocket launched to date. It will likely need to launch on a Starship cargo ship. But what about after that? Why not build the telescopes in separate components, launch the components separately, assemble them in orbit, and then push them out to the Lagrange points? It seems like a large part of the delay with JWST is the testing of the assemblies to make sure they don't come loose during launch. Perhaps this wouldn't be an issue if it is just assembled in orbit.
With Starship hopper tests happening this year, we're going to start seeing regular starship launches next year. Their goal is to eventually be able to turn around and reuse an entire Starship stack in 72 hours. They could reach that in a couple of years. LUVOIR isn't expected to be ready until 2035. We could probably move that up so much sooner if we assemble it in space. Hell we should double it's size in that case.

Sorry for the ramble but I just think the rate of our progress in space exploration is pathetic."

Our [NASA SpaceX Crew-1](https://www.nasa.gov/crew-1/) mission is the first fully certified flight of [NASA’s Commercial Crew program](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html). Experts across NASA and SpaceX have been reviewing designs, preparing astronauts, running simulations, checking launch conditions, and taking care of a multitude of other tasks to get ready for the Crew-1 mission to the International Space Station. We are here to answer your Launch America questions! Ask us anything about:

 - The Crew-1 mission and its biggest challenges
 - The science the Crew-1 astronauts will be conducting during their six-month mission aboard the orbiting laboratory
 - How the astronauts have been getting ready for the mission
 - How preparing for the launch at Kennedy Space Center is like (and unlike) launching the Space Shuttle
 - NASA’s Commercial Crew program and what it means for the future of human spaceflight
 - How educators can use NASA resources to teach students about spaceflight
 - How government partners like the Federal Aviation Administration work with NASA to ensure mission success
 - What it takes behind-the-scenes to make a mission like Crew-1 happen

We’ll be online from 1-2:30 p.m. ET (10-11:30 a.m. PT, 18:00-19:30 UTC) to answer all your questions! We are:

- Paul Crawford, Commercial Crew Launch Vehicle Office chief safety manager, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center - PC

"10","2020-11-16","Why is there so little info about the SpaceX Merlin engine compared to the Raptor?","Basically, what it says in the title. For Raptor, you can find plenty of unofficial drawings of the engine in extreme detail.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor#/media/File:Raptor_Engine_Unofficial_Combustion_Scheme.svg

https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/cxkrtb/detailed_diagram_of_the_raptor_engine_er26_gimbal/

Presumably, this has been reverse-engineered by some aerospace fanatics (side note: I'm personally an aerospace engineering student and spent much of last week staring at engine cycle diagrams, including the ones above, for a homework assignment.) For the Merlin, it is much harder to find a similar sketch of the engine cycle, besides one diagram of a proposed ""Merlin 2"" and generic gas-generator engine diagrams.

I understand that the Raptor is a far more interesting engine compared to Merlin, which uses a fairly standard gas-generator cycle. However, I'm surprised that in 10 years of Falcon 9s and a few more years of Falcon 1s, that nobody has came up with a sketch similar to the above Raptor diagrams.

I understand that SpaceX keeps this kind of thing secretive, ITAR restrictions and all. But that begs the question - why is the far more complex Raptor so much more readily documented? Googling ""Merlin engine diagram"" mostly yields results of... Raptor engine diagrams."

This would provide a very large space, one that would be the basis for the space station.  The smaller fuel tanks would only provide enough fuel to get it into orbit.

It could be purpose built on the ground, and if needed, things like solar panels and experiments, food, etc., would be shipped up after the initial flight to orbit.

From a young age, I thought that the best way to do this would be to major in Astronomy or Astrophysics, but now I'm realizing that this isn't so much the case. From what I've heard, engineers (aerospace, electrical, computer) are much more prominent in NASA, and Astronomy majors end up going to be professors or participating in small laboratory research (which definitely isn't as appealing to me). So, what should I major in college? As of now I think I'll do Aerospace, but am still not completely sure. I know that setting my path to work at NASA probably seems really far fetched, but I want to take the best route possible to eventually end up working in at least something future-space mission related, because I find that stuff so cool to think about. Is is it true that taking up engineering in college proves to be much more versatile? Any suggestions?"

I'm aware of Rocketlabs, Relativity  and Blue Origin, a few start ups like Astra (not direct competitor), and of course China who seem extremely dedicated to space.

I know any answer will be a rough estimate, but I'm curious as to whether SpaceX are extending their 'lead' so to speak in the field, or if finally there is some competition on the horizon."

Used the search tool and couldn't find anything related to the topic.  

Optimistically, SpaceX says they plan to land their first Starship on Mars ""well before 2030"". I fully understand that this will be unmanned missions for quite some time. And I also fully understand their primary focus is Starship for this purpose long term. 

But since the sole goal of these initial Starship flights would be to begin populating Mars with necessary, long term, supplies, equipment, building materials, and so-on... why not just start test sending 'stuff' now with a vehicle they know is capable of getting there today? 

Wouldn't it make things easier/quicker to have some of this already in place for the long term? Even is its just small, but somewhat frequent (when launch windows are open) shipments of several tons of 'stuff' that can sit there?

To be clear - I'm not talking food, water, fuel, or perishable necessities for human life. I'm talking items required for building the 'foundation' of eventual life on Mars. 'Stuff' that, if it sat for 20+ years, would still be needed and useful to have there long term.

With the optimistic goal of getting *a* Starship on Mars within the next 6-7-8ish years, it doesn't seem like starting to send things 'now' would be too early. 

Just curious if there's a reasonable explanation (reasonable for musk I should say) for why they aren't putting more resources into this if the vehicles already exist."

As much as the starship works as the earth orbiter, they don't make a lot of sense as the moon lander or deep space transport which requires vastly different specifications. For example, I see people criticizing the BO moon lander for being unrealistically designed but a 50m tall spacecraft landing on the moon doesn't seem realistic either.

Considering the fact that they would be faced with rising competition, wouldn't it make more sense for SpaceX as a corporation that profits from signing governmental contracts to at least attempt to design suitable spacecraft such as designated moon landers or orbitally-constructed deep space transports in order to win contracts?

Edit: The people's points have been that 'Starship works for all challenges' but as contract-based companies, I believe that there would be **always more optimized solutions**. The starship has massive LEO capabilities, but I don't think that's the major required spec when it comes to different objectives. The Moon lander will need to be designed with astronaut safety in the lunar environment in mind, rather than simple launch weight capabilities. "

Senator Shelby is retiring next year and it seems like critics of SLS have the upper hand at NASA. NASA had to have considered the full potential of starship when picking it. If they just wanted a simple lander they could have gone with dynetics, or if they wanted to reward lobbyists they could've gone with the ""national team"" frankenstein lander.

They chose starship because of its capabilities, and they want to support the future it represents. NASA is going all in on starship, not SLS as the future of human spaceflight."

"0","2021-04-18","My dream for the SpaceX Lunar Starship","I am just a random space enthusiast who is so unbelievably excited that the SpaceX Starship will be NASA's choice for the Human Landing System for Artemis. That being said, the current plan as it is currently laid out could be, in my opinion, improved upon going forward. So here is my personal dream for Starship, NASA, and the moon.

NOTE: I doubt any of this would be in place for the first starship lunar trip, I would expect that to play out close to how it is currently designed. However, with some modifications over time, this dream could become a reality.

**The Current Plan**

SpaceX will first launch the Lunar Starship into orbit and begin refueling operations. Lunar Starship may be carrying an initial cargo payload to support the lunar mission, this is unclear at this point. Tanker starships will re-fuel the vehicle with the Methane/Oxygen fuel known as Methylox until it has enough fuel for its mission. Then NASA will launch astronauts in the Orion space capsule aboard the SLS rocket into orbit as well. Roughly simultaneously both Orion and Starship will begin their Trans-Lunar Injection Burns. Both ships will enter lunar orbit, where they will dock. Crew will then transfer from Orion to Starship, before landing on the moon using Starship. When they are finished, they will ride Starship back up to Orion. Finally, with the crew back in Orion, both ships will leave the moon and return to Earth. At this point, I would expect Lunar Starship would remain in orbit (no heat shield or flaps for re-entry) until the next mission, while Orion would perform the re-entry maneuver.

If the Lunar Gateway is already built by the time this happens, then the crew transfer would happen by both vessels docking with the Gateway, however I'm not convinced that the funding is there for this yet.

**First Change: Starship Fuel**

Methylox is a challenge for in-situ refueling. Starship is intended to be refueled on Earth or Mars, where Methylox can be easily produced. However, on the moon there is no methane, therefore Methylox manufacturing is a challenge.

Switching to, say, Hydroxyl (Hydrogen/Oxygen) fuel opens the door for a fuel production facility on the moon to supply the Lunar Starship. Yes, we would have to build that first, but given the drastically lower costs of launching from the moon vs the Earth, this would be a worthwhile investment for the other items I dream of.

**Second Change: Lunar Starship As Sole Vehicle**

It is absurd to think about how the crew is traveling in the tiny, cramped Orion while the massive, spacious Starship flies empty next to them. As NASA gets more comfortable with Starship, there is no reason why it couldn't be the sole vehicle for the entire mission, taking astronauts from the Earth to the moon, to the surface, and back again.

**Third Change: Earth-Orbital Payload Transfer Between Starships**

One of my biggest personal criticisms of Starship from day one has been the refueling. You need, what, 6 additional launches to put enough fuel in one ship to make the trip? In many ways that defeats a lot of the cost savings Starship offers.

However, in this fantasy I'm laying out here, tanker Starship refueling wouldn't be necessary. The Lunar Starship, if it ran on Hydroxyl, could refuel on the moon for what is ultimately a much cheaper cost than the tanker operation in Earth orbit. On Earth, a single Starship would be launched containing the crew and cargo that needs to go to the moon. This Starship would dock with the Lunar Starship in Earth orbit and transfer it's payload (human and material), and then the Lunar Starship would ferry that to the moon while the other Starship would just return to Earth.

The docking and cargo/crew transfer would require some creative interfaces to support large payloads, but it could be done.

**End Result: An Efficient Earth-Moon Transit System**

The direct launch approach represented by Apollo, SLS, and even the current plans for Starship and Mars is just highly inefficient in my opinion. Launching from a strong gravity well is a completely different task from traveling in space. By having Lunar Starship be a perpetual space-faring vessel, simply picking up crew/supplies at the Earth or the moon and bringing them to the other, I feel the cost of travel between the two would be significantly reduced, thus accelerating the colonization of the moon.

A similar system for Venus and Mars would further improve our ability to expand out into the solar system.

**Conclusion**

I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking about this, but it's been on my mind ever since the NASA announcement. Now all that needs to happen is SpaceX needs to figure out how to land a damn Starship without it exploding haha."

SpaceX is [launching satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-broke-satellite-launch-record-one-month-2020-6) into space by the dozens to realize Starlink, a globe-encircling constellation of spacecraft that beam affordable, high-speed internet [across Earth](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-unlikely-winner-fcc-rural-digital-opportunity-fund-subsidy-2020-8).

So far, the scheme — envisioned by SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2015 — seems to be working. The aerospace company has even [opened a public beta test](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-enough-satellites-to-launch-public-beta-2020-10) across the northern US and southern Canada for [$99 a month](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-public-beta-how-to-join-price-cost-subscription-2020-10), plus $499 for a startup kit.

&#x200B;

 However, the unprecedented project has left a trail of seemingly unresponsive spacecraft in its wake. All of the satellites are designed to be maneuverable in space using an ion engine, and even deorbit themselves to burn up in Earth's atmosphere. But satellites with malfunctioning communication or propulsion systems can fly uncontrolled and pose a hazard to other satellites, and even astronauts, circling Earth.

SpaceX launched its first batch of 60 prototypes [in May 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-internet-satellites-weird-deployment-video-2019-5) and, to date, has flown 895 total Starlink internet satellites. But so far around 2.5% of those spacecraft may have failed, according to data collected by Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

""I would say their failure rate is not egregious,"" McDowell told Business Insider in early October. ""It's not worse than anybody else's failure rates. The concern is that even a normal failure rate in such a huge constellation is going to end up with a lot of bad space junk."" 

&#x200B;

 

one of those failures may be intentional tests, but how many (if any) is not publicly known because SpaceX hasn't released such information. As a result, astronomers like McDowell have resorted to analyzing [satellite-movement data](https://www.planet4589.org/space/stats/megacon/starbad.html) gleaned from SpaceX and the US government, showing which Starlink satellites have fallen back toward Earth and which ones are not maneuvering. (McDowell's failure calculations do not include 45 ""version 0.9"" satellites that SpaceX is known to have intentionally deorbited.)

 

&#x200B;

 Before the end of October, McDowell was measuring a 3% apparent failure rate, but a recent reanalysis indicates improvement in the newest Starlink batches. Of the last 413 ""version 1.0"" satellites, only one appears to have died, giving these batches a failure rate of just 0.2%. Still, McDowell notes that many of these satellites have only been in space for a few months, so more of them are likely to fail going forward. ""Nevertheless it does seem that the reliability of the satellites has noticeably increased,"" he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1321843474270965760) on October 29. 

&#x200B;

 

SpaceX has permission from the US government to launch nearly 12,000 Starlink satellites through 2027, though it's asked to [launch 30,000 more](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-internet-satellites-itc-filing-30000-additional-42000-total-2019-10) for a total of nearly 42,000. In either case, SpaceX is on track to form a ""megaconstellation"" that outnumbers all prior spacecraft ever launched by humanity. If 3% of the maximum planned Starlink constellation fails, that could mean 1,260 dead, 550-pound satellites the size of a desk aimlessly circling the planet. A 2.5% failure rate could mean more than 1,000 inoperative spacecraft.

There were about 3,200 nonfunctional satellites in Earth's orbit as of February, according to the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers). Many of these dead spacecraft regularly threaten to collide with others and create a space-debris crisis. In mid October, for example, satellite trackers flagged a [""very high risk"" close pass between a dead satellite and a discarded rocket body](https://www.businessinsider.com/soviet-satellite-chinese-rocket-might-crash-in-space-2020-10?_ga=2.155345403.1503971106.1620208783-1693620875.1620208783), with one company calculating a 10% chance of collision. (Fortunately, they didn't.)

&#x200B;

 SpaceX says its satellites will naturally deorbit, or burn up in Earth's atmosphere, if their propulsion systems don't work. But that process can take up to five years, according to [Starlink's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20201014004938/https://www.starlink.com/). In the meantime, defunct satellites rocket around Earth faster than a bullet, with nobody to steer them away from other spacecraft that may fly in their path."

Not sure if you meant :

* cheap to develop
* cheap to build for the prototypes so far
* cheap to build the future operational design
* cheap to fly

Designing the hardware to be cheap to build in large numbers helps all of the above.

It involves using relatively cheap materials (stainless steel vs aluminium alloys or composites), cheap manufacturing (welding rather than milling aluminium or laying up and curing composites), and developing an efficient workflow.

It also helps to not build expensive factories until you have evolved the production process.

Prior experience with building and flying the Falcon rockets will have helped.

A **low cost to fly** is the goal of Starship, and full reuse, frequent flights, **many flights for each Starship**, and cheap recovery and maintenance, will all help.

Once the hardware has flown a hundred times, its manufacturing cost becomes almost irrelevant. Once the design has flown a thousand times, even the development costs dwindle per flight.

Eventually the operational cost might approach just three times the cost of consumables, under the $2 M cost per flight that Elon is aiming for.

The depth of knowledge Elon has about his machines is just incredible.  I honestly believe that he knows where every nut and bolt is on Raptor and Starship, its relevant loads and limits, and is already thinking about how to make that specific part better.  Not only that, but he also demonstrates an amazingly broad knowledge of the general subject of rocketry.  Could you imagine Jeff Who or even Tory Bruno walking through their own factory and remotely having that level of detailed understanding?  Boeing?  Forget it.

Now, the flip side of this that I find terrifying-- if something happens to Elon, SpaceX likely dies with him.  He's the singular driving force and vision behind that company, and even if he fills the company with similarly motivated and passionate people there's a long list of companies that thrived under a leader like Elon, but collapsed shortly after the leader retired or died."

"0","2021-12-27","The Future of SpaceX, Starlink and the Starship Program. Had this idea after watching the last video from Everyday Astronaut.","# Starlink

First, there could be a growing opposition against Starlink in the future.

The European Space Agency already had to maneuver their own scientific satellites to avoid collision with a starlink satellite, while the Chinese also had to move their station twice to avoid a potential collision. The CNSA even recently complained to the UN via UNOOSA. Starlink could cause SpaceX a lot of trouble in the future, financially and politically.

Some small event might turn the controversy into a widespread concern towards Starlink and SpaceX. It will be one of the biggest event at the moment, and you will see a bunch of memes about Starlink and SpaceX polluting the orbit emerging. The popularity of SpaceX and Elon Musk will inevitably go down because of this.

SpaceX could be constrained by the United States Congress to revise Starlink downwards or to give up the project of a giant constellation altogether.

SpaceX could also take the decision to revise the ambitions of Starlink downwards by themselves after declaring bankruptcy, without the government interfeering (this scenario might be more likely).

# Starship

I think Starship could take much more time then anticipated. The orbital launch might happen a few months only before SpaceX declares bankruptcy because of Starlink and Raptor production. At this point, the Staship program could be on the verge of collapsing. Blue Origin would probably sue NASA/SpaceX again to take advantage of the chaos.

SpaceX and the Starship program could be saved in extremis through government fundings (mostly to save the Artemis program) and private investments. The expectations of the vehicle could be revised downwards. This might unfortunately mean no point-to-point Starships and Mars fantasies anymore.

It might nevertheless succeed at carrying Astronauts to the Moon at the some point in the early 2030s. The Chinese might be able to achieve the same thing at around the same time.

I don't think any human will step a foot on Mars soil before 2040, unless an expected technological breakthrough occurs. When it will happen, the vehicle might be so different to the current Starship that it'll most likely be considered as another type of rocket spacecraft.

# Title

I would really like you to prove me wrong, I really like SpaceX and their projects but that's how I (unfortunately) the future of SpaceX, Starlink and the Starship program. Anyway, we'll see how it plays out.

By the way English is not my main language, I apologize for the spelling/grammar mistakes. Sorry for that."

"557","2022-02-07","What do engineers at old-school aerospace firms (Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Arianespace, etc.) think about SpaceX?","I'm curious to know if there's any general attitude or consensus, whether positive or negative (envy, contempt, skepticism, respect, rivalry, etc.). And has it changed over time as SpaceX has hit new milestones?

Or does it perhaps depend on the age of the engineer? Or their personal feelings toward Musk in general? Or whether their livelihood is tied to preserving the status quo with respect to government contracts, etc.? 

My question is motivated by a conflicting set of assumptions that I'm curious to reconcile. On one hand, presumably most people who go into aerospace engineering are personally excited by space exploration, and presumably many have been disappointed by the lack of progress after the Apollo era. In this light, SpaceX's success with reusable rockets, and their plans for low-cost heavy launch systems and Mars colonization should be, at a minimum, very exciting. And beyond that, perhaps light a fire for engineers to want to quit their current employment and seek jobs at SpaceX or other space startups.

On the other hand, based on my own experience with several such firms (circa 2000), I've never met a group of more risk-averse, change-phobic, stodgy, ossified-thinking, ""it can't be done"" people in any industry, ever (including automotive and pre-breakup Ma Bell telecom, so that's saying something). Presumably there was a long history of incentive structures to engrain and reinforce such a culture, but I'm speculating. And the famous negative responses of Apollo astronauts to Musk's plans makes me wonder if their attitudes are representative of generational institutional biases."

I know that at least one ula rocket uses rd180s, so I'm sure there will be some felt impact.. Some. And he's correct, rd180s are some of the world's best rocket engine.. For now.

Problem is, they're acting like they're going to actually impact American launch capability when it's very unlikely that they will. Worst case scenario (for America), they cost us some money. Best case (for America), SpaceX, other private companies, and nasa themselves are funded more adequately and our superior economy and infrastructure once again shits on their launch capabilities.

What exactly do they think they're going to accomplish? Did they put an idiot who doesn't actually understand the current state of space exploration in charge of roscosmos, or is it just a threat that they're hoping the American/Russian public will believe?

It is a completely acceptable strategy to push forward space travel. NASA is aiming for a lunar colony in the long run as it seems with its gateway project. Russia and China also seem to have similar plans. Yet it leaves aside a complete change of paradigm of how to approach space travel in the next steps.

The, or one alternative would be to do the next step closer to home. Although the ISS has stepped up size from the Mir, it's in no way the upper limit. Especially since with SpaceX's Starship, a space station as the ISS could be transported with 5 launches load-wise. Also, the ISS still is too small to discover many aspects of a space station.

The next step in space habitation could be a massive orbital space station that functions as an orbital shipyard, a large artificial-gravity habitat capable of housing dozens of crew, a powerful nuclear powerplant to power welding operations to build a big ship. Maybe the shipyard element could be added at a later date. But a massive habitat and an arboretum in an artificial gravity environment to grow food and restock oxygen would create many new variables to play and experiment with. A rotational section of a space station big enough for crew members to almost permanently work under ""gravity"" would  create a new opportunity to learn about methods to counteract space-related health risks.

Instead of investing in bases on celestial bodies, an alternative would be to build a massive space ship. It would omit solar panels and use nuclear power (fission, thorium or at a later stage fusion power). It could be built step-by-step. A 100x100x100 big cube could be built, maybe assembled from highly flexible sub-cube modules and the ship could even be made bigger, adding versatility and mission flexibility.

The idea would be to possess a space ship, that can move around the Solar System completely independently of gravity slingshot maneuvers if needed. Such a ship could contain massive artificial gravity habitat cylinders for the crew of dozens of people, massive cargo holds could be used to transport material for missions, docking bays, laboratories, telescopes that eclipse current space telescopes in size, building or mining material.

These ships could be used in the next step to build an energy/ressource infrastructure in the Solar System. It could be used to build automated/robotic power plants, fuel refineries. And massive mining operations could be used to build new ships directly in space close to the ressources in a second shipyard. This shipyard could make use of 3d-printing, automatization, AI and manufacturing robots.

A fleet of these ships could be used to explore the Solar System. They could even be completely automated for some missions.

This approach tries to liberate itself from the gravity well of a planet as fast as possible in contrast to Elon Musk's strategy to use planets as spaceships so-to-speak."

What, in your opinion, is the biggest risk of SpaceX achieving it's goals? Political? Technical? Business-related? Elon himself?

My current thought is quality-driven bureaucracy will erode the cost savings which seems integral to their plan. For example, when a particular part fails, like the previous F9 strut, they layer on additional supply chain checks. This makes sense, of course, but it's also easy to see how layers and layers of mitigations after every setback creates it's own bureaucracy. If those checks are needed before a rocket is reusable, it could potentially erode the savings of the reusability. My worry is that if conservative customers, like NASA, require certain levels of quality (particularly in the aftermath of a mishap), it could breach SpaceX's core advantages."

It looks to me like they will be forced to use a much more traditional space approach.

It took them 4 or 5 attempts to make the first Earth landing of Starship, with 3 or 4 months to get data and adjust a similar testing plan for Mars it will take 2 years just to make an successful test landing."

Then their next attempt failed just minutes before launch.  Then their third attempt—presumably absolutely _lavished_ with special care and foolproofing so that there would be no chance of anything going wrong—has two thrusters fail, perhaps bringing the whole mission just a single thruster failure away from total loss.

What would NASA's response be?  Would they require another do-over?

I am inspired to ask this question because, as the Angry Astronaut points out, NASA decided that these thruster failures weren't enough of a red flag to abort docking this dubious craft with the ISS anyway.  There are many people living there right now.  I agree with his assessment: This feels like NASA taking risks so they can fast-track Boeing's craft.  And I certainly can't visualize NASA taking such risks (with human lives on the ISS) for SpaceX's sake."

VivaTech 2022 has wrapped up and some exciting speakers came out from the Spacetech sector. For those who are unaware, Viva Technology, or VivaTech, is an annual technology conference, dedicated to innovation and startups, held in Paris, France. It’s a huge event where there are over 2000 exhibitions, a perfect place to have a feel for what future we are heading towards. Three  speakers who were involved in Spacetech are of interest. There was Space Cargo Unlimited CEO Nicolas Gaume, Managing Director of SpacePharma Daniel Campbell, and  founder of Sirius Space Services Antoine Fourcade. 

Space Cargo Unlimited and Spacepharma are two companies with similar interests in microgravity. Microgravity has shown to provide many benefits in Space R&D  such as drug discovery, 3D printing, cell culturing, and many more. Because of the benefits mainly directed towards biotech companies Space Cargo Unlimited formed a subsidiary dedicated to in-space biotech called Space Biology Unlimited and it’s going to be working with Mercier, a  global vine nursery company, on figuring out how to grow new grape vine varieties that are more resistant to changes in the climates. 

SpacePharma, also focused on providing biotech research in Microgravity environments by developing miniature labs with microfluidics. With their labs they were able to bring research of all kinds such as DNA, cancer, meat culturing, and drug analysis onboard spacecraft like the Axiom-1. Most interesting is that their labs are almost fully automated so no extra personnel is needed.

Sirius Space Services is a French company that presented their goal  to improve  sustainability and reduce the cost to  access Space by  developing 100% reusable launchers. These small launchers named Sirius, offer low ecological impact for nano, micro and mini satellites that weigh under 800kg. This reduction in cost and sustainability improvement will help 3rd party companies perform their experiments in space similar to how SpacePharma and Space Cargo are doing. 

These three have caught my attention because I’m starting to realize there is a huge revolution of private space tech companies. Each year I see many more start ups popping up and surpassing the challenges that Space presents. Just like looking at tech companies in the car industry, energy sector, medical sector, and more, it's time that we notice SpaceTechs growth. It's exciting stuff."

After all this time at the top, it was all gone. America was no longer regarded as on the cutting edge in space and many other countries were outpacing us, and were on course to demolish everything we achieved. NASA was an agency in crisis, with dwindling funding and ambition, along with increasing inefficiency; a deadly combination which have corrupted agencies like Roscosmos. The days of the Apollo program seemed like a distant memory.

Fast forward a decade, and we are back on top. We have reusable rocket tech, we can (again) send astronauts to the ISS, we have ambitions far greater than any other program, and we are moving faster and more efficiently than even the Chinese. We are building 2 megarockets, the SLS and the Starship, and we are advancing space tech at a rate unimaginable since the end of the space race days. To me, this is the ultimate resurrection story.

[https://youtu.be/wpeWfn1PFtw](https://youtu.be/wpeWfn1PFtw)

Motivation

A SpaceX mission on July 22, 2022 marked the 132nd successful propulsive landing of an orbital-class rocket booster.  I wanted to capture all launches in the same frame to highlight how far we've come in rocket reusability since the first landing in 2015.

Boosters recovered and reflown in this manner save millions of dollars in launch costs. A new booster costs around $50M. Each time one is reflown results in substantial savings, some of which is passed to the customer.  A reusable launch system reduces the cost of access to space and opens up new opportunities almost impossible under the traditional launch model.  The canonical analogy is that of flying on an airplane - you don't throw away jets after one flight but reuse them over and over. At the time of writing, the record for reuse is 13 flights for the same booster.

The Method

First, all 132 videos were downloaded from Youtube. Each was 1920x1080, except for NASA-hosted broadcasts, which were 720p (c'mon, NASA :))

I expected the final product to be chaotic and noisy (what else can you expect from 132 simultaneous rocket launches), but strangely coordinated in some ways. But in particular, I wanted the countdown callouts to be in sync - 132 announcers counting down at the same time: ""10"", ""9"", ... So, with the help of family members I had the timestamps for the ""10"" moment and the touchdown recorded in a spreadsheet.

The timestamp for the countdown had to have millisecond precision or else it won't work. So, I had to use Audacity to hunt for that exact waveform and replaced the coarse timestamp in my spreadsheet with the precise one.  This was the most laborious part of the process.  I'm sure some signal processing technique would make this child's play, but I didn't know any.

The timestamp for the landing was a bit of a hit-and-miss. Footage of landings on barges often cut out at the final moment before touchdown due to interference, so on the video they're not as coordinated as the countdown.

With the timestamps ready, a Python script iterated through every footage to extract the clips, resize them, and stitch them into 11 rows, each row with 12 clips.  Each clip is 160x90, preserving the aspect ratio.

The Result

Here are some comments and observations:

The flight that marked the first successful recovery is on the top left.  The order of missions goes from left to right and top to bottom, with the 132nd flight on the lower right.

Many of the launches' flight profiles were remarkably similar, with the same events from several flights happening within the second.  It is amazing how such powerful engines could be so precisely throttled to produce such consistency.

Somewhat counterintuitively, the combined rumble from the rockets was louder with fewer clips, e.g., 5 rows. On reflection, this could have been due to some sound cancellation happening with more samples.

The combined raw sound from all 132 flights was so chaotic and bordering on headache-inducing that I had to attenuate frequencies above around 4kHz.

Different announcers had different rhythms, creating an echo effect. Some flights started at ""5"", one or two did not have the countdown announced.

My favourite part is just after stage separation, where upward-facing cameras on the boosters light up together after second stage ignition, from around 3:00.

When I started this, I didn't plan on 132 clips, but 144, the number that would fit exactly in a 1920x1080 frame at 16:9 for each clip. By sheer coincidence, Flight 132 was only a few days away, so suddenly I had a deadline.

The completed video was released within one hour of the 132nd launch.

Problem being, they have a QR code or other link trying to get people to send them cryptocurrency so they can ""double it."" I think many of us will probably already avoid it, but I wanted to give the warning. DO NOT send them money, either crypto or not. You will never see it again.

Youtube has already taken down at least three of these videos, but given how many different channels have started posting basically the same thing, I think we'll probably see a lot more before it gets handled.

On Thursday 20th, SpaceX will attempt the first ever flight of its full Starship rocket, which will launch from southern Texas. Unlike previous tests, this launch is aimed to reach space, and will involve both the lower 'Superheavy' booster and upper 'Starship' stage stacked together.

With 33 raptor engines on its lower stage, this rocket far surpasses any previous rocket in the amount of mass it can deliver to orbit. This makes this test **the first launch of** **the most powerful rocket in history**. However, they've chosen not to enter orbit on this first test. Instead, Starship will reach only near-orbital velocity and will circle 2/3rds around the world, re-entering in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. It is hoped Starship will survive re-entry but there are no plans to recover it and it will be destroyed upon splashdown. The Superheavy booster will actually attempt a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico near the launchpad, however it will not be recovered and will be made to sink to the bottom of the ocean.

[You can find a detailed timeline of the launch + other details here](https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-test)

Remember: the first test flights of rockets historically have a high failure rate. That is what test launches are for - to identify failure points. If the test flight is not deemed successful, they have multiple rockets waiting in the wings to repeat it.

>the company has collected about $9 billion in private funding since its founding in 2002.  
>  
>Mo Islam, a former Wall Street analyst who works for Payload Space, has written a [projection of SpaceX revenue](https://payloadspace.com/predicting-spacexs-2023-revenue) in 2023, coming up with a forecast gross income of $11.5 billion—nearly twice what Islam estimates the company earned in 2022. That suggests investors value the company at about 12 times its revenue.

...

 

>Musk has said that Starship will cost the company between $5 billion and $10 billion to develop; Musk estimated that Starlink’s total cost will be about $10 billion.  
>  
>That network, according to SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell, is likely to be cashflow-positive this year.

The $10 billion for Starship and $10 billion for Starlink sound about what has been stated before. The revenue is nice but some of that will come from cost inducing activities like F9 launches. 

Starlink being close to break even on revenue is useful but they will begin to need to refresh the on orbit hardware. This will be a cost without new revenue associated as its simply going to be refurbishment not increased bandwidth. 

Very high level but chimes with what we have heard over the years. Its also how Musk likes to run companies all gas and no brakes. 

From this over view you can see how its supposed to work and how it could fail. 

Then again this is how it all started as per Eric Bergers book, run on the edge of bankruptcy and stellar success."

This would be the largest spaceport in South America, surpassing even the port of Kourou that France has in Guyana.

This was also confirmed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global strategy consulting firm, in a recent article highlighting the possibility of more 'gateways to space' being created.

The 53 spaceports that exist in the world belong to Europe, Russia, China and the United States. These are the ones who have historically contested the space race. The vision would now have changed and the future would lie in expanding the launch points to other parts of South America.

In this perception, according to BCG, the Paita desert, in Piura, located in the north of Peru, is the one with the greatest potential to become a new 'space gate'.

Even transnational giants like SpaceX can count on the port, since it reduces their launch costs by locating it in a strategic area.

A weird question. Like, probably really weird. Recently I started writing a book about SpaceX as a hobby. It is meant to be a gift, so I want it to be as informative and engaging as possible. I wanna describe the company's history, interesting projects and the Mars colony concept. I've already written about the Falcon rockets' history - it has Falcon 1, some paragraphs on Falcon 5, Falcon 9 (v 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) and Falcon Heavy. In the 'modern' chapter I wanna write about Starship and SpaceX cooperation with NASA for Artemis program. It will also have some info on space tourism.

Then I wanna start writing a huge chapter on Mars. But here I'm a bit uncertain, that's why I decided to ask here. Ideally, I wanna write about what is needed to colonise Mars first, what basic concepts on Mars colonisation we have and what issues may arise during the process. Where do I start besides Wikipedia? Preferably I'd like to read some nice articles, not 1M page books as I have a time limit to do this, although not a harsh one...

Thanks in advance!"

 Then, since you’re are going to need off shore launch pads anyway when Starship is fully operational, construct ones now even if only at a basic no-frills level for the test launches also. Plus, another benefit is during the test launches you’ll also be gaining experience in doing the necessary off-shore launches."

However, over time his public perception has taken a massive hit, as more and more people have come to despise his character.

On the one hand his numerous affairs, and controversial political views have led most people to despise his character. But on the other hand, his drive to invest and pursue in new and risky space technology has pushed man kind forward and has led to significant advancement in the space industry. Advancement that more than likely would never occurred without his presence and commitment. 

Given his amoral character along with his undeniable desire to pursue game changing space technology, do you still think elon musk is fit to run SpaceX.

Personally i think future generations will look back on Elon Musk in a similar fashion to how we look at Wernher Von Braun today. Both men were immensely amoral human beings, whose actions thrusted humanity into a better future. "

To solve the problem, I started [RF-Careers.com](https://www.rf-careers.com/), a job board dedicated to the RF Engineering community!

I know SpaceX is quite active in this field, so I created a dedicated web scrapper to group their jobs - please take a look! The majority of the positions are in RF Engineering, Antenna, and RFIC design and they seemed focused on the Starlink and Startshield programs!

So NASA has to wait for SpaceX to have the system ready.

What if, hypothetically, SpaceX just decides to launch a Starship HLS independently private astronauts a/o customers before NASA? They could do it, pretty easily actually. The first Artemis landing hinges on Starship HLS and SLS being ready, a private SpaceX landing just requires Starship HLS. 

If this happens, what would be the fallout? Would a NASA/SpaceX rivalry actually develop? Would SpaceX have a market for lunar tourism? Would it initiate the quicker construction of a lunar base?"

- Quick note: I really love what space X is doing regardless, I just thought it would be valuable to have this discussion.

I've been pondering the environmental implications of rapidly reusable rockets, especially in light of SpaceX's ambitious missions. 🙅‍♂️

I'm keen to dive into discussions about the ecological footprint left behind by these groundbreaking technologies and SpaceX's strides in reusable rocketry.

Here are a few points I would love to explore.

- **Resource Consumption:** How do the manufacturing and maintenance of rapidly reusable rockets affect resource usage and waste generation compared to traditional space launch vehicles?
- **Emissions and Pollution:** What is the comparative impact of rocket launches on the atmosphere and surrounding environments, considering both traditional and reusable rocketry?
- **Long-term Sustainability:** Can advancements in rapidly reusable rockets align with long-term sustainability goals in space exploration, or do they pose challenges in terms of environmental conservation?

SpaceX's efforts in achieving reusability have reshaped the space industry, but it's essential to scrutinize the environmental implications amidst the excitement of technological breakthroughs.

I'm eager to hear your insights, analyses, and informed opinions on the environmental repercussions of rapidly reusable rockets, particularly in the context of SpaceX's missions. Let's engage in this critical conversation about the balance between innovation and environmental stewardship!

Looking forward to the discussion!🚀"

I love that the video is extremely positive towards Starship and getting humans to Mars. It is also the first ""popular"" video I´m aware off which gets the negative life approach and the belly flop right. 

However one major part of the video is completely wrong.

Starship will ***not*** slow down via its engines prior to hitting the martian atmosphere for aerobraking. It will hit the atmosphere at interplanetary velocity. 

The erroneous idea that spacecraft *intended to land* on Mars have to slow down before aerobraking has emerged on the internet in the recent months. And I don't know why. 

All the rovers NASA has send to Mars in the last 20 years didn't slow down before aerobraking. They slammed into the atmosphere and used their heat shields to slow down until they were slow enough to deploy parachutes or execute their landing burns. 

.

This post is intended to clear up this misconception and maybe generate a bit of publicity for how EDL (entry decent landing) actually works for spacecraft.  "

"1","2024-01-21","As a member of the Communist Party of China, I wonder why so many American people are opposed to SpaceX’s participation in the moon program? Thinking SpaceX should only consider Mars and not the moon.","China plans to achieve manned landing on the moon before 2030 (2029) and establish a permanent base on the lunar surface. The size of the lunar surface base will gradually expand over time. Not just surface bases, China also plans to build a lunar orbital space station and a lunar orbital bombing system on the orbital space station. Due to cosmic radiation, the lunar surface is not suitable for survival, so the permanent base on the lunar surface is actually underground, and the tunnel excavation work is actually completed by the lunar orbital bombing system. Yes, a tunnel is directly blasted through fixed-point constant bombing (perhaps thermonuclear warheads) tunnel, and then allow the entire spacecraft to land directly in the tunnel to serve as a temporary building and continue to expand.

China is not alone. China has established an international lunar research alliance with Russia and other countries, of course the core is China.

Moreover, based on China’s experience in the South China Sea and Taiwan, China will one day claim that sovereignty over the lunar base and its surroundings belongs to China, that sovereignty over part of the moon’s orbit belongs to China, and even sovereignty over the cislunar space also belongs to China. If the United States wants to go to the moon, it must apply to China and submit protection fees.

(China claims all sovereignty over the South China Sea, which is China’s territorial waters. Taiwan also belongs to China. A few years ago, China also claimed that the Taiwan Strait is also China’s territorial waters. Foreign ships and aircraft theoretically have no right to pass through the Taiwan Strait without China’s permission.)

I have seen a lot of posts recently. Many people are opposed to SpaceX's participation in the moon project and think that SpaceX should focus on Mars. Get Blue Origin or other companies involved in the moon project. We all know that SpaceX is the most powerful company, while the power of other companies is much smaller. Blue Origin never even reached any orbit. Some people even oppose any lunar project, believing that the United States' goal should be set directly on Mars, and that the moon has no meaning.

Technically speaking, delivering supplies to the moon and establishing communications with the moon are much simpler than Mars. Mars only has a chance to land once every two years (taking into account the period), and the moon has a chance every day (the period is negligible in emergencies). Moreover, the delay of establishing a high-speed communication network with the earth on the moon is much lower than that on Mars, a few seconds compared to 2 hours. And they all leave the earth and go to an environment that is completely unsuitable for human survival. Although Mars has an atmosphere, it is carbon dioxide, not oxygen. The moon would be a significantly easier first step for humans to leave Earth and establish permanent settlements.

If SpaceX can participate in lunar projects on a large scale, I believe that the construction of lunar bases in the United States will be much faster. If SpaceX does not participate in the moon, I think the national power of the alliance between China and Russia will surpass those small companies in the United States and claim the sovereignty of the moon. Are the moon, lunar orbit, and earth-moon orbit so worthless to the United States? Or does it have no value in itself?

So much so that many Americans, perhaps even Elon Musk himself, despise the moon and think it is a waste of time. Are Americans so short-sighted? Only thinking about dollars (economics) and not political power? (Capitalists will eventually sell their nooses.) The goal of the Chinese Communist Party is to dominate the world, to make all mankind obey the orders of the Communist Party’s top leaders, and to pass on the red country from generation to generation."

n a [statement](https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Commitment%20to%20Space%20Sustainability.pdf)  Feb. 12, SpaceX said it would perform controlled descents of about 100  “early-version 1” Starlink satellites out of concerns that the  spacecraft could fail in orbit and no longer be maneuver.

“These satellites are currently maneuverable and serving users  effectively, but the Starlink team identified a common issue in this  small population of satellites that could increase the probability of  failure in the future,” SpaceX stated. The company did not elaborate on  that issue or identify the specific satellites affected.

According to [statistics](https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html)  maintained by Jonathan McDowell, SpaceX has 5,438 Starlink satellites  in orbit, out of 5,828 launched to date. The oldest still in orbit are  from an initial group of version 1 satellites launched in 2019 and 2020  that lacked visors added to later satellites intended to reduce the  amount of sunlight they reflect, reducing their brightness. Of those 420  satellites, 337 remain in orbit.

SpaceX said the satellites being deorbited will lower their orbits  gradually over about six months. “All satellites will maintain  maneuverability and collision avoidance capabilities during the  descent,” the company stated. “Additionally, these deorbiting satellites  will take maneuver responsibility for any high-risk conjunctions  consistent with space safety and sustainability best practices.”

The growth of the Starlink constellation, by far the largest in  orbit, has triggered debate about space traffic management and space  sustainability. There has been a push for new regulations to govern the  growth of satellites and debris and ensure satellites are promptly  deorbited at the end of their lives.

During a panel discussion at a space debris conference organized by  the Saudi Space Agency Feb. 12, Ernst Pfeiffer, chief executive of  German space component company HPS, called for new rules for deorbiting  satellites within five years of their end of their lives, versus the 25  years previously endorsed by organizations like the Inter-Agency Space  Debris Coordination Committee, or IADC.

“This can be introduced tomorrow, a five-year deorbit time,” he said,  after which more complex rules can be developed. “This is urgently  needed and, amazingly, Elon Musk is introducing it already with SpaceX.”"

"1","2024-04-11","SpaceX mission to Mars","There was some additional information revealed recently so aat least the general shape of the mission is a bit clearer.

- In short, at the latest presentation Elon said SpaceX will launch ""thousands"" of Spaceships to Mars every 26 months, using Hohmann transfers. 

- A lot of those Spaceships will be full of cargo and equipment. 

- Plan is to build a 200 tonne to Mars version, and launch large numbers of those at the same time. After refueling in Orbit. 

- Some of those will carry the crew. Hopefully, probably several of them.

- I believe Elon meant ""a colony of million people in 20 years"" - did not specify anything about the very first habitat, first landing. 

I think its safe to assume ""thousands"" of Spaceship is one of those Elonisms and will not be available for quite some time. But, the plan is to launch a lot of spaceships, all at once every 26 months.  

Only it does not make much sense to send cargo and equipment only every 26 months - if another option is possible. Equipment and resources do not need the fastest flight to Mars. Cargo can be sent using Ballistic capture transfers, which enable us to launch something multiple times throughout a single Earth year. These flights will take longer to reach Mars than those using Hohmann transfers, but if you time them right, once they start arriving to Mars they can land there every few months or even more often. In effect establishing a continuous supply chain to Mars.

Ballistic capture transfers have been used on eight missions so far, the latest being JAXA Slim Moon Lander which also confirmed that type of transfer can achieve pin point precision in landing. It is also much gentler then Hohmann transfers because it does not require any strong slowdown burns and high speed orbit injections.

The second big thing is the location for the very First Base. Elon wants the location to be somewhere bellow 40 parallel, half way between the poles and equator. The reason for that? Solar panels...

Mars receives 40% of Sunlight the Earth does. And while solar energy production is possible on Mars i will argue the first bases need a more robust, continuous, reliable and fail proof type of energy production. Nuclear energy is the only technology that can provide us with that on Mars. New, next gen small modular reactors.  Something like this would do nicely: https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/novel-nuclear/micro-reactor.aspx or, a bit bigger micro reactors. https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/

Fortunately Elon also mentioned that having nuclear reactors on Mars (especially early on) would be very beneficial for any colony.

But the location of the First Base is not decided on. 
The presentation also had the basic requirements for location shown, and it seems someone is convinced we need to set up a huge mining and processing operation - and unaware there is a location with plenty of water available on the surface. 

What we will need the most on Mars is water. Water ice. If you go closer to the equator all you can find are water ice deposits which are thoroughly mixed in and covered with hundreds of meters of Mars regolith, volcanic ash and dust. That means we will need to establish gargantuan mining operations to dig out thousands of tonnes of Mars ground - and huge industrial processing facilities where we will extract water from that ""soil"". Because we will need to use Mars water to create air for our Martians to breathe those kinds of deposits cannot provide us with amounts we will need.

A single human needs 10.000 liters of air to breathe every day. No Moxie machine can create that out of 1% of Earth atmosphere. Right now those can create a whopping - up to 10 grams per hour. If anything the Moxie machines should be in every room of the future base, serving as air refreshers. We can get the amounts of air we need only from Korolev glacier. Or well, we can get the oxygen. The rest of the mix we need to actually breathe we need to figure out. There is no water ice anywhere closer to equator enough for that, and propellant and agriculture and the other industries and usual everyday human needs.

Why would you do that if there is a source of easily accessible, purest water ice on the surface of Mars?

The Korolev crater is the best and practically the only possible location for the First Base. It contains the biggest permanent surface glacier of water ice on Mars. Water ice trapped by the crater from the atmosphere. It is 60 km wide and 2 km thick glacier of purest water ice we can find on the whole Mars with amounts of water usually compared to the Great Bear lake in Canada.

Yes, it is close to the North polar cap. But that actually provides further advantages. First, it is in the deep blue areas of Mars.

https://imgur.com/a/ppYwLXf

Same map without the tweet icons: https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/V01/SceneView/MurrayLabCTXmosaic.html You have to switch to the topographic map in the menu on the left.

This is the deepest part of the planet, where the ancient Mars sea was. That whole area is up to nine kilometers deep, so it has the highest amount of ""air"" pressure. 

Another advantage is that because it is in Mars polar night for half of Mars year it provides additional protection from Sun radiation.

And if you are worried about that, the actual conditions are fairly mild:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#Surface_conditions

    *Ionizing radiation from cosmic rays, the Sun and the resulting neutron radiation produce radiation levels on average of 1.369 millisieverts per day during lunar daytime, which is about 2.6 times more than on the International Space Station with 0.53 millisieverts per day at about 400 km above Earth in orbit, 5–10 times more than during a trans-Atlantic flight, 200 times more than on Earth's surface*.

    *For further comparison radiation on a flight to Mars is about 1.84 millisieverts per day and on Mars on average 0.64 millisieverts per day, with some locations on Mars possibly having levels as low as 0.342 millisieverts per day.*

You see, in some areas on Mars (in the deep blue) radiation is less than what astronauts get on the Space station. And the average is not that much higher. That is, radiation you would get if you were a sensor exposed directly to it.

I would suggest building the first base in the mountains of the crater rim. Underground with a view style. A Martian sietch, or human sized Hobbit houses under the hills, with exits to the outside area and tunnels leading down the the crater floor so we can get to the glacier itself. A few pressurized balconies and terraces with a view of the glacier and the whole crater under them. 

One of the great advantage of having humans on Mars is that they could remotely operate a lot of construction and research machinery. First from the comfort of the Spaceships while they build the first base, but later from the base itself as we build roads, fuel way stations and other bases too. At least a good part of the construction, with personal handiwork added as needed. 

*(if we choose the location for the first base it would allow us to build prototypes of it on Earth and have future Martians practice building it until they can do it blind. Even send all the important structural and other parts to Mars in advance, have them land in drop zones near the location, which would allow for relatively rapid construction once humans get there)

We would need huge amounts of construction machinery and other equipment and resources delivered to Mars to achieve that but that can be done by using Ballistic capture transfers, before we send human crewed ships using Hohmann transfer (fastest route, possible only every 26 months).

This kind of Mission can result in the First Base built within a decade. not two or more. And in a location which will guarantee the survival of a large number of colonists, and their safety and security. Even provide an ease of mind. On Mars."

It can compete against FH, especially for higher orbits due to it's hydrogen upper stage and its relatively inexpensive cost of under $118m. It might be able to help with NASA's Artemis missions but how useful will it be when Starship comes online? The launch price of Starship (as of right now) is $100m, which is still cheaper than a Vulcan and 50% more capable when bringing stuff to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (Vulcan VC6 can carry 14.4t to GTO, whereas Starship can carry 21t). I'm not optimistic, at least in the near future, about refuelling a Starship 10 times in orbit with 10 other Starships (which is required to bring stuff to the Moon) although I think that SpaceX can eventually do it. In the meantime, Vulcan might be able to excel in that, but then again FH exists, is around the same price, and is more reliable.

How is Vulcan supposed to compete anyways? Will a bigger rocket be made to compete against Starship?"

The fourth flight test of [Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) could launch as soon as June 6, pending regulatory approval.

A live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30 minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and [on X @SpaceX.](https://twitter.com/SpaceX) The launch window will open as early as 7 a.m. CT. As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates.

[Starship’s third flight test](https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-3) made tremendous strides towards a future of rapidly reliable reusable rockets. The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first ever opening and closing of Starship’s payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration. This last test provided valuable data for eventual ship-to-ship propellant transfers that will enable missions like returning astronauts to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis program.

The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy. The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.

To accomplish this, several software and hardware upgrades have been made to increase overall reliability and address [lessons learned from Flight 3.](https://www.spacex.com/updates/#flight-3-report) The SpaceX team will also implement operational changes, including the jettison of the Super Heavy’s hot-stage following boostback to reduce booster mass for the final phase of flight.

Flight 4 will fly a similar trajectory as the previous flight test, with Starship targeted to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry.

The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon. We’re continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond.

However, compared to the hundreds of billions that were put into the development, planning, assembly, upkeep, and ongoing habitation, would this not be just a drop in the bucket of monies expended by the various partner organizations?  
Additionally, wouldn't having the ISS in a reserve or graveyard orbit potentially be a boon one day? Be it for parts, construction of additional stations, an emergency island, etc.  
So many losses, material, engineering, data, etc., seem to be on the wrong side of the balance sheet. Mothballing or parking simply seems like the most educated option.

So, to begin with, all my life I've never been a protectionist, I've always been a bit of a libertarian, an advocate of private initiative and open economies, I've always seen this as the best think that would bring peace between nations, sharing wealth, development and knowledge with each other. ISS it's an example of that.

 And in the last decade I've even cultivated a huge admiration for SpaceX, I lost count of the launches I watched in the early years, at one point I even had my sons watch a launch live with me, with the sound volume at max, etc.

But since a few years ago, basically since Elon Musk started spending his life on Twitter, I realized that the guy, by the way CEO of SpaceX, was a shitty person. 

I started to realize this actually years before he decided to buy Twitter himself, it was in the cave crisis in Thailand. It was then that I realized that Musk had a pretty fucked-up personality, for some reason onlye he knows. And at the time, I couldn't have guessed that he would later buy Twitter and turn the whole thing into a social network where racists free to hang around.

Forgetting that bit, Eumetsat is a european agency, funded by the state budgets of many European countries.   
ESA is also a european agency, funded by the state budgets of many European countries. And even the satellite is being built by a private european company, Franco-Italian, but it's obviously European taxpayers who are paying for it. 

As a european, I don't mind paying more for a launch than having my taxes handed over to a company run by a fascist-putinist like Musk. But no one seems to have bothered with this decision. Does anyone know why?

I published my doubt before the launch of Ariene 6, it was intentional, whether it's a failure or a success."

NASA would end up going back to a 1960s style expendable Saturn style super heavy rocket and Apollo style capsule which NASA could barely afford to operate on it's current budget.

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic was busy spending money, resources, and manpower to develop suborbital thrill rides for the wealthy and the lucky.

Boeing was developing a Saturn style rocket called the ""Space Launch System"" and was developing a taxi cab to the ISS called ""Starliner"" which has been a farce.

SpaceX was trying to make Falcon 9 reusable, develop a Falcon Heavy for military use, and develop a capsule to take astronauts to the ISS. This was the most exciting space program during the 2010s but pales in comparison to the excitement, inspiration, and scale of the Apollo program.

What if instead of aspiring to merely restore human spaceflight to LEO and at least the Moon as well as developing suborbital thrill rides American society and it's space programs instead aspired to create a fully reusable super heavy rocket and spacecraft that would make having Moon and Mars bases much more affordable as well as paving the way for asteroid mining and the construction of rotating ring space stations?

That same system would also lead to much more capable asteroid defense and deploying more advanced satellites to monitor Earth's climate and global warming.

If all the money, manpower, and resources that went into SLS, Orion, Falcon rockets, Dragon spacecraft, and Starliner instead went into a Starship like system could we have had a spacecraft like Starship fully operational by now?

If not then should society and government should have had bigger dreams than to simply restore human spaceflight to LEO and the Moon as well as the suborbital thrill rides?"

"1","2024-08-18","Why SpaceX needs a True Chief Engineer.","
 SpaceX has made multiple basic errors of in developing the Starship. The unerring conclusion you draw is SpaceX needs a true Chief Engineer.  

A major realization that is being missed is that rather than needing multiple refueling flights and several additional years of development to get reusability right, by going initially for an expendable Starship and adding a small 3rd stage, we can do single flight missions to the Moon and Mars now.  

The key point is *expendable* SuperHeavy/StarShip has 200+ ton payload capability NOW. Robert Zubrin showed 2 reusable SuperHeavy/StarShips flights at 100+ ton payload to LEO can do Mars missions:   

Mars Direct 2.0 - Dr. Robert Zubrin - IAC 2019.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5k7-Y4nZlQ   

Then 200+ tons gets SINGLE LAUNCH to Mars. Clearly, also gets SINGLE LAUNCH to the Moon. In other words, the upcoming IFT-5 stripped down to expendable could do a SINGLE LAUNCH demo mission to the Moon at ~$100 million launch cost with F9 upper stage as a 3rd stage/lander and Dragon as crew capsule within a month. This compared to the $7 billion to $8 billion total cost all-up for a /SLS/Orion/Advanced SRB’s/Boeing EUS/Starship HLS/Gateway/ Artemis plan involving 10+ refueling Starship launches.

But the Gemini program was in the 60s, and spacecraft engineering has come a long way since then.

I can only guess that the cost outweighs the need, but I'm wondering if there is any more to it than that?

"1","2024-10-21","Having concerns about SpaceX's impact on Artemis","Hi so I'm not a hater i think a lot of SpaceX's work is incredible and in particular their driving of media interest and publicity in spaceflight as well as providing new launch capabilities to the ISS.

However Starship has always had skepticism from me, I felt as though the interative design was wasteful and overly expensive and so far has yielded little results. I was surprised that NASA announced Starship for the HLS but i was optimistic as maybe the $3billion from NASA would push SpaceX to develop HLS in a similar timeframe to Dragon but after seeing all the excitment around the booster catch and finding out the cost...I am now really fearful Starship will kill Artemis here is my logic and explanation.

We know that NASA awarded a little over 3billion to develop HLS on the basis of SpaceX's timeline in the proposal and that it was one of the largest factors as the actual HLS' capabilities were not what NASA was looking for but was promised to be cheaper and quicker than Dynetics or Blue Origin. We all know the Artemis program is on thin ice with legislators despite being perhaps the most important government initiative of our lifetimes so any cost overuns and issues are under extra scrutiny such as with the reports about SLS.

Public data shows that as of the most recent IFT SpaceX has already spent the entire budget and is 2 years behind schedule as in their proposal they promised to have uncrewed landings by '24 so at current tragectory we're looking at closer to 10-15billion by 2030 while the rest of Artemis like the SLS and Orion are already complete while Gateway and the Spacesuits should be ready by around 2028. It is also severely unlikely SpaceX will pay out of their own pocket as they already reuqested an extra billion last year.

Lets put into perspective why the cost and time frame is an issue.

Starship has cost $3billion and taken 7 years from initial design (2017-2024) and is still yet to complete any of its contracted milestones.

In comparision to the Apollo Lander which cost $2.4billion for 8 fully developed Landers which landed on the moon 6 times + a test mission over a span of 6 years even if we assume NASA was twice as inefficient as they were in 1967 NASA could have made the lander in house for less than it's likely to pay SpaceX in less time.

SLS gets a lot of hate from SpaceX folk, talk about throwing stones from a glass house. 20billion over 8 years and a 100% success rate it may have been more expensive but it will have been quicker and had no failures while Starship still hasn't completed a mission.

If I haven't also made you raise concerns think about what we have potentially lost from this investment, we could have had 6 Opportunity Rovers or 2 Curiosity, 3 sets of Voyager spacecraft, 2 launches of SLS, 2 new ISS modules or god knows how many deep space probes or Earth observation sats. While under the SpaceX contract we've gotten...a load of metal in the indian ocean or the nature preserve around Boca Chica.

My main issue is I see many areas within the development of Starship where they are spending more basically for the sake of it? There's no reason for a 100 ton to orbit capability, theres no reason to land both back at the landing site when you could just upscale the proven tech of landing on droneships with legs or whatever else.

If it is going to continue to be funded by Taxpayers then they should only be developing for HLS and i've yet to see a single thing that is actually towards that goal oh and maybe they should stop throwing half a billion dollar spacecraft away instead of using a sensible long term design process instead of appeasing their attention deficit CEO."

"1","2024-10-27","Could SpaceX send humans to Mars by the 2030s following an architecture consisting of BEO optimized Falcon Heavies and Red Dragons?","SpaceX won't be sending people anywhere anytime soon with Starship, which makes me wonder if an architecture with Falcon Heavies could be faster.

They should be working on something like this since at least 2015 if they are going to send people to Mars a decade or so from now.

That is, to build BEO optimized Falcon Heavies (taller cores with upgraded merlin engines, larger second stage with more than one engine, apparently in expendable configuration only and human rated to carry manned Red Dragons).

In reality, the Red Dragons were intended to be unmanned test landers. But in this scenario SpaceX decides to make them human rated deep space vehicles, and have the ability to land/take off from Mars.

But the technology isn't ripe enough to send humans to Mars. The first problem is all the radioactivity between Earth and Mars that we have no idea how to protect ourselves from. On Earth the ISS is protected by the Earth's magnetic field and the same will partially apply to the Gateway.

So, assuming SpaceX has been working on something like this since the 2010s, they could be in the 2020s or a little earlier testing and evaluating deep space technologies, either in very high Earth orbits or on or around the moon. That is, they could dock upgraded Dragons with special habitation modules, to increase the time the crew could stay in HEO or BEO, or, as the Artemis program intends, build a small scientific outpost on the surface of the moon for testing technologies. The moon is practically the best place for such a thing.

And when they were technologically ready (and preceded by test unmanned missions to Mars), they would launch a BEO optimized Falcon Heavy with a Red Dragon, which would then dock with a habitation module (which would either be a co-manifested payload or already in  orbit) and would go to Mars.

 There it would leave the habitation module in Martian orbit and land on Mars. There the crew could do various experiments-research etc., and could utilize equipment such as pressurized rovers or pressurized labs-habitats that would have already been launched there from previous missions.  And when they were done, they would use ISRUs to generate fuel and launch into Earth orbit, re-dock with the habitation module and return back to Earth."

SpaceX was created with a simple but ambitious mission: to make life multiplanetary. Why? Because Earth is fragile. From natural disasters to human-made threats, it’s clear that we need a backup plan. But beyond survival, space exploration is about inspiration, discovery, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Here’s how SpaceX is making that happen:

1. Reusability: Rockets were once single-use and astronomically expensive. SpaceX changed that with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, creating rockets that can land and fly again, drastically reducing the cost of space travel.


2. Starship: The next step in space exploration. Starship is designed to carry humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. It’s not just a spacecraft; it’s a leap toward creating a sustainable human presence on other planets.


3. Starlink: Space isn’t just about exploring distant worlds. Starlink is providing high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas on Earth, proving that space technology can directly improve lives here.


4. Mars and Beyond: The ultimate goal is Mars colonization—a challenging, but necessary, step for humanity’s long-term survival and growth. Mars will teach us how to live sustainably in harsh conditions, which will have profound benefits for Earth as well.



At SpaceX, the mindset is simple: no challenge is too great. We’re not just building rockets; we’re building a future where humanity thrives across the stars.

Let’s keep reaching for the impossible—because that’s where progress happens.

"1","2024-11-19","Advantages SpaceX gets from Starship in first-to-market ","Despite the obvious and enormous current and future revenue stream, I doubt SpaceX views Starlink as very important long-term. LEO internet service is ""small potatoes"" compared to the vast array of new industries that will bloom once the $/ton to LEO drops below a certain factor.

That paradigm shift will give SpaceX a massive head start position in those new industries, a leverage potential far beyond the market cap of LEO internet service. Starlink is merely a stepping stone (and not just to Mars.) 

There are trillions to made by the first-to-market in those new industries, some of which may be entirely unforeseen right now. And who will be in a better position to gain dominance than the company that owns the first ""airline"" to space?

 Zubrin had previously successfully prevailed upon Elon to reduce the size of the original BFR to its current half-size. Could Elon now be convinced to mount a smaller system still with the Starship as 1st stage and a mini-Starship as upper stage? Elon could still build his Superheavy/Starship but the implications of a Starship/mini-Starship are stunning:

SpaceX can build a Moon or Mars rocket for ca. $10 million. Now.
Such a rocket could offer costs of $100/kilo to orbit. Now:

I'll admit I was skeptical at the beginning of the Starship program but with each test flight I am beginning to believe more and more in the dream of a fully reusable system.

If back in the 90s and 2000s NASA was much better at rocket development and NASA and the US government was fully committed to developing something that would achieve the dream of the original space shuttle how early could we have seen a revolutionary launch vehicle like ""Starship""?

2011 when the ""Shuttle"" retired? 2015? 2020?

I heard in the 90s NASA was developing something called the ""X-33"" and it ended up being cancelled and then ""Constellation"" with it's Ares-1 and Ares-V rockets was started by Bush and then cancelled by Obama and the Ares rockets became the ""Space Launch System"" and there really wasn't a strong direction at NASA during much of the 2010s until ""Artemis"" was started.

Where would we be today if from the 90s-now NASA and the US government was fully committed to developing a fully or mostly reusable architecture for crewed missions to the Moon in addition to keeping the ISS, Hubble, Mars rover, and Shuttle programs that would not only pave the way for crewed Mars missions but make crewed Mars missions much more affordable because of a partially or fully reusable super heavy lift rocket?"
