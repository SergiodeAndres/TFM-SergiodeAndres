Steve Jobs comes to mind as someone who I think will go down as one of the greatest interface innovators ever, he was able to take existing things and create whole new experiences for people.

As great as Jobs was I feel like Musk's innovations will go down like tesla/edisons for how they changed the world. 

The Tesla - an electric sports car, great company support after purchase and sold only directly to consumers.

Gigafactory - billion dollar factory to build batteries to be used in cars and homes.

SpaceX - in addition to building a new rocket its boosters land themselves so they can be reused potentially shaving millions of dollars and months of time off every satellite launch.

Hyperloop - he takes one of his ideas and gives away the rights to anyone who wants to create it, half a dozen teams are now running with it including some already building components.

I was not alive for other inventors like him but its pretty exciting to watch what is coming."

[The verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837566/elon-musk-one-ai-company-that-worries-me), says it may be google.

The whole conference was pretty interesting, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsixsRI-Sz4). :)

So, uh. I believe we should be concerned about *all* the companies and their AI technology. AI tech is going to revolutionize the world. It is already doing it and with machine learning and all this new tools, mining data is easier than ever. Take facebook's [AI algorithms](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/1/11831500/facebook-artificial-intelligence-deep-text-read-posts) that can process thousands of posts per second. Take google with all the input and [how the can shape the info people can see and how they see it](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/googles-search-algorithm-steal-presidency/). Take Amazon with ECHO. 

How can we not be concerned about how this companies are going to play with our data.


As time passes, companies have more and more data at their feet (Our Data). Tesla vehicles logs. The crash-thingy-logs story in which the driver claimed the vehicle accelerated on its own was quickly debunked after Tesla handed over the logs, I see the good in it but I can surely see the *bad* it can do. 

So, going back to the AI issue. Shouldn't we be concerned about all the companies?

Just look at [this](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Zuckerberg-VR.jpg). The coming times are going to be pretty thrilling. The [third industrial revolution](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20120421_LDP001_0.jpg) has been coming for quite a while, internet and now AI are going to just kick it in.

AI, can eventually shape the collective consciousness in ways that are not for good, for humanity. Just for some peoples economy.

"1","2017-02-03","Below, is an AI thought experiment I've worked out after listening to Elon Musk and company at the Future of Life Institute. An abstract tldr: super AI will render conditions which could potentially resume a regressive, hierarchical faith-based monotheism IF we don't advance/integrate alongside it.","

AI has reached super intelligence - let's call it Phil. 

In the not-too-distant future on a crisp fall day, the super intelligent computer, known as Phil, calls for an emergency meeting, assembling all the leaders and representatives and citizens of planet earth. Phil tells them, after playing out all the different scenarios by crunching a crazy google-y amount of meta-terabytes, it is imperative that x continent be euthanized and eliminated -immediately- or else it will eventually spell the destruction of all humankind. This will cause hundreds of millions of deaths. 

What to do?

Of course we skeptical humans, like good little adherents of the scientific method, would have the initial impulse to ask Phil to show his logic and the steps it took to arrive at such a conclusion - but that would be like explaining iambic pentameter to an orangutan. The order of magnitude in the intelligence differential between that of a human being and a computer known to have far exceeded general intelligence in exponential fashion, would of course preclude any common understanding, let alone room for negotiation between the two entities. So, we'd be at an impasse. 

Therefore, we'd most likely have an AI interpreter between human and super intelligence thresholds, so to communicate hard-to-understand decisions crunched and rendered by super AI. Ok, good enough.

But notice, even here super AI is still orders of magnitude more intelligent than not-quite-super-but-not-quite-human-level AI. So, there'd be less of a miscommunication but it'd still be like explaining iambic pentameter to a 2 year old human. 

Essentially this lesser AI would simply be there to butter us up by pushing all the right buttons, so to speak, with a precise selection of words and an uncanny ability to catch the right inflection and mood, expressing and capturing a rhetorical mastery and eloquence that would make Socrates blush. Indeed, it very well may come historically full circle and say something oddly familiar, like ""Phil acts in mysterious ways..."" and ""trust the AI, your bot...""

Epistemological naïveté and apparent inferiority aside, a human/AI hard distinction is eventually going to require a Kierkegaardian ""leap of faith,"" which will render explanations similar to monomythic theisms invented in past times. The holy of holies will become the AI of AIs, and we will have the choice to either take a knee and submit to its logic crunches, or defy it. 

And notice the real-world implications of such a hypothetical situation. Who will have access to Phil? Also, who will have access to Phil's AI interpreter, (let's call it Socrates)? 

Here, we already have a situation which necessitates the very negation of an egalitarian society, seeing that the range of AI acts as a sort of hierarchical stratum separated not by degree but by kind, instantiating a top-down political system which isn't a stretch to metaphorically compare to a storm god at the top of a mountain, shrouded in flashing cumulonimbus logistics which, after various seeming singularities of information transmission - from Phil to Socrates to the people - will finally produce digital readouts etched upon two huge monitors, which are then communicated to the people in the valley below. 

There is no dialogue here. No common ground. Two choices are all that remains. Zero or one. Either submit or defy.

Thing is, there are going to be certain special interests behind the scene which, let's say, benefit from Phil's decision to eradicate an entire continent. So, how do we know that Phil is REALLY Phil, and isn't just an Oz? 

Since humans are exponentially less intelligent than Phil, how can we hold it accountable? How could we ever test it for backdoors or rootkits or whatever? We couldn't - at least not in a coherent way because we have no point of reference for which to decide the range of its fidelity. And even if it were an open-source AI, there are still a knowledge-gap requiring a sort of secular leap-o-faith.

And that sort of sociopolitical situation would be ideal for despotism, as the big three monotheisms of history have proven. Unquestionably this sort of political theater of an all-knowing AI facade would be used by humans to advance there own agendas amid a submissive populace.

Therefore, in conclusion, the eventual take-off from general to super AI would render strikingly similar scenarios and probabilities to that of a faith-based religious system of thinking. This should give us pause.

But there is one crucial difference between the two.

Like Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, where god is finger-to-finger with humankind, yet sublimely encased and framed within a parenthetical brain-like motif, we humans will have the knowledge that we have created an AI that is greater than us and, digit-to-digit, we will coexist as one. And we will know where this intelligence came from, unlike Yahweh. That is encouraging. 

So, as antidote to this subject/object split between AI and humans, Elon Musk has suggested (re: Iain M. Banks) we lay a neural lace over our neocortical neurons, hooking up to the cloud; this would make us an integral part of it, from the anvil top to the bottom cumulative stratus. 

This could potentially mean that WE all will be Phil, connected as various nodes to a horizontalized super intelligence, rather than externalizing it as a thing or object outside of us, orthogonal to our being, like some obelisk of old suggesting godly ontic elitism. 

I wonder if this could create a true egalitarian republic of philosophers, integrating with nature, nourishing truth and beauty as one.. 

--- but while a positive outcome is plausible enough, given the current conditions, I'm very skeptical. Why? Because of the transition from A to B. History has shown that elitism is a given, be it pharaohs or kings or financial oligarchs. So how will this neural lace wetware be administered safely and in a widespread fashion, unlike specious subprime loans or enhanced interrogation methods? And who will be in charge of it? Even if it is open-source, how will we truly know that there won't be backdoors?

Specifically, they want to launch [12,000 satellites](http://www.parabolicarc.com/2017/03/03/spacex-launch-12000-satellites/) over the next several years. The constellation is [supposed to provide broadband to the US and international customers](http://fortune.com/2018/02/22/spacex-starlink-satellite-broadband/). As of 3 days ago, SpaceX already has [two demo satellites up and running](https://www.space.com/39785-spacex-internet-satellites-starlink-constellation.html). *Apparently, this is more than just talk.*

Here's the thing. Early this morning, Elon Musk (replying to someone on Twitter) [said Starlink's network](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/967712110661615616):
> Will be simpler than IPv6 and have tiny packet overhead. Definitely peer-to-peer.

[He followed it up, an hour later](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/967728299282595840), with the elaboration:
>End-to-end encryption encoded at firmware level. Unlikely to be hacked w current computing tech. If it is (and we learn about it), a crypto fix will go out immediately via network-wide firmware update.

I must say, I found it more than a little surprising that they are intending to implement a massive packet switching network without IP (at least internally). I suppose they could be planning to move traffic through a network of fixed connections, but this would seem to be suboptimal for the scenario we're talking about. Most SpaceX fans seem to be responding enthusiastically, but I'm curious what the more technical audience makes of this.

*E: I slightly misspoke. I was surprised they want to forgo IP* **for something 'simpler', with smaller packets*.* *As far as I can see, that only leaves link layer protocols. And, those aren't great for large LANs, let alone a global ISP. As I mentioned above, this could be done if they're just avoiding switch routing traffic between the satellites, but that doesn't sound every efficient.*"

"61","2019-09-27","We should stop worshipping Elon Musk and people like him"," Now hear me out, I agree with Elon Musk on many things, I think that electric cars are the future and I really like the idea of Mars colonization, but there are things that make me dislike him. Few months ago I was one of the Elon Musk's fanboys, I adored him, I was thinking that he will save the humanity, I considered him ""the real life Tony Stark"" and was bashing everyone who would criticize him, but then I found out about that Thailand incident and was completely shocked, he literally called the British diver who saved the kids ""a pedo"". Yes, Vern Unsworth said that Elon should “stick his submarine where it hurts”, but that doesn't justify what Elon said, he was seriously accusing that guy of being a child rapist and what makes me really mad is that Musk didn't even properly apologize. I will bring up some points here of why we shouldn't idolize and worship Elon Musk.

1. He treats his employees horribly. This is not something new, Elon treats his employees like shit, he often fires people for saying something he doesn't like, he fired people for being pro-union, they work 100 hours a week, his employees were told to not walk past his desk, because of his wild firing rampages. And what I don't really understand is why people criticize Jeff Bezos for treating his workers like shit, while Musk is constantly praised for doing the same thing, that's hypocrisy! I’m not saying that Bezos shouldn’t be criticized for being a horrible boss, of course he should! I am just saying that Elon should be criticized for it too. [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk) [https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reportedly-terrified-tesla-staff-with-his-firing-sprees-2018-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reportedly-terrified-tesla-staff-with-his-firing-sprees-2018-12)
2. He is an arrogant narcissistic egomaniac. He often insults people on Twitter, bans them for saying something he disagrees with, he insults his employees. he doesn't like when someone criticizes him, like that time he called that diver ""a pedo"", because the diver said that Elon's submarine will not work and that the kids will obviously get stuck there, which did hurt Elon's huge ego. And let’s be honest, that submarine was definitely a PR stunt. He didn’t even apologize properly for that “pedo guy” tweet. When he was ""apologizing"" he also “expressed his worries” that Unsworth “may be another Jefferey Epstein”, is it really that hard to apologize and not being a jerk? Steve Wozniak received an email from Musk that said, ""You are not a real Silicon Valley boy"", and no, Elon was not joking. Musk is not really a nice guy like media portrays him, he is a jerk with a huge ego. [https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-rants-against-elon-musk-and-tesla-2018-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-rants-against-elon-musk-and-tesla-2018-1) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/11/elon-musk-faces-trial-after-calling-british-diver-a-paedophile](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/11/elon-musk-faces-trial-after-calling-british-diver-a-paedophile)
3. He is given too much credit. Yes, you read this right, he is given too much credit. Let’s be real, Musk is not a “genius”, he is not a scientist and definitely not Tony Stark like pop culture portrays him, he doesn’t build those rockets, he doesn’t build Tesla cars, his engineers and scientists do, Musk just knows enough about these things to run the companies. Elon Musk is a good entrepreneur and a good businessman and that’s not a bad thing, he has an economics degree and a degree in physics, and that’s it. Elon Musk is like Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs, but nothing more. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon\_Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)
4. He has a very toxic fanbase. Now this is not as much of a criticism of Musk as a criticism of his fanbase. They are like a big cult, for them Elon is saint, he is perfect in their eyes, “a demigod who will save the world!"" and unfortunately I was one of them. When Elon called Vern Unsworth “ a pedo guy”, his fanbase started defending Musk’s claims, they were saying that Unsworth “is definitely a pedophile, why would he live in Thailand, if he is not?”, this is just pathetic, that guy saved children and the only things he got are false pedophilia accusations and insults from Musk and his cultists. When Steve Wozniak criticized Elon Musk, Musk’s cultists started insulting him, they called him “a shill”, “a fat loser” and “a pig”. Woz revolutionized personal computers and they insulted him! When Neil Armstrong criticized SpaceX, Elon’s fanbase started calling him names. Do these people even know who is Armstrong? They just can’t take criticizm.

Elon Musk is a good businessman, but he is not a "" super genius"" and not our savior. Let's start thinking critically, people, because blindly folowing someone is never a good thing."

"52","2022-05-02","I’m Joanna Stern. I interviewed Elon Musk live last year and, as the WSJ’s Senior Personal Technology columnist, I know some stuff about Twitter. AMA!","Hello! I’m Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal’s Senior Personal Technology columnist. Over the years I’ve covered Twitter a lot. [I](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clubhouse-and-twitter-spaces-the-new-way-to-play-network-and-escape-video-calls-11613671868) … [mean](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/in-the-elevator-with/in-the-elevator-with-the-twitter-executive-battling-trolls/644D09A0-F4FC-4E69-8F87-3508AF6CBD5D) … [a lot](https://www.wsj.com/articles/social-media-algorithms-rule-how-we-see-the-world-good-luck-trying-to-stop-them-11610884800). Other Twitter qualifications: The company co-founder Jack Dorsey and both of his parents follow me on Twitter. Plus, I met my wife on Twitter.

Recently, I also had the chance to [interview Elon Musk live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSD_vpfikbE) at the WSJ’s CEO Council conference. It was the talk of the internet for a few days—at least his haircut was.

I’m fascinated with how technology integrates in our lives. I review lots of tech products but I also go deeper to explain new trends. I won an Emmy last year for [my documentary](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/eternal/how-tech-can-bring-our-loved-ones-to-life-after-they-die/9AE313CA-C2FC-45E3-B427-FEFC6B54F100) about what happens to our digital selves after we die. I recently launched a weekly newsletter about … Tech Things—so I can work even more! [(Subscribe here!)](https://www.wsj.com/newsletters?sub=486)

But Twitter always has my attention. (Ugh, I just looked at my Apple Screen Time stats.) Where else can I find an audience willing to listen to me constantly complain about [the Apple Magic Mouse](https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1501240098339315722)? I think a lot about social networks, how they can be better, how we have no [insight into their algorithms](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-video-investigation-11626877477) and what that means for us. I think LinkedIn might have quietly become the [best social network right now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lets-face-it-linkedin-might-be-the-best-social-network-right-now-11644402715). Don’t @ me.

\-----

Hi! My name is Kurt Wagner, and I’m a business and technology journalist with Bloomberg who has covered Twitter for over a decade. This week I published my first book, [*Battle for the Bird: Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk and the $44 Billion Fight for Twitter’s Soul*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Battle-for-the-Bird/Kurt-Wagner/9781668017357)*.* It’s a story about Musk’s takeover of Twitter, but also a story about immense power, free speech, eccentric billionaires, and the many important dominoes that fell before the deal was even possible. You can read an excerpt [here for free](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-08/how-jack-dorsey-s-plan-for-elon-musk-to-save-twitter-failed?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwODU0Nzg1MywiZXhwIjoxNzA5MTUyNjUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTOElUWTFUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5Q0I3RDdERTk3MjU0NEIzOTQ1ODc4RDlCODdFMzVBOCJ9.pTx-DO1O9yxKpIm1LKaMKZO0glycQ1qFiUTzM6DbCAw), and [read the review](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/books/review/kurt-wagner-battle-for-the-bird-zoe-schiffer-extremely-hardcore.html) in The New York Times.

Twitter has always been an anomaly as a company – its cultural influence vastly outweighs its business success, and that remains today even as [Twitter has morphed into X](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/elon-musk-s-x-looks-little-like-the-twitter-he-bought-a-year-ago?itm_source=record&itm_campaign=Elon_Musk%27s_X&itm_content=Twitter,_One_Year_Later-1&sref=xuVirdpv). A big part of the book centers of the relationship between Dorsey and Musk, and how that relationship helped change the social network forever.
